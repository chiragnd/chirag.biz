<p>Jobs, the movie</p>
[embed][www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH1jKZwcS9Y[/embed])
<p>The trailer for <em>Jobs</em> just debuted ahead of its August 16 release. I’m intrigued, it looks decent, and I don’t mind Ashton Kutcher at all but I don’t think he generates the screen presence you’d expect of someone playing Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>His dialogue delivery — particularly Apple announcements and the iconic Think Different ad — just don’t sound strong enough. I’ll watch it, but my expectations are low.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: I couldn’t get through more than half of it.</p>
