<p>Briefly,<strong> BakeFestDXB</strong> is an initiative by organizer Nick (also known as the dahlink of Twitter — <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/theregos" target="_blank">@theregos</a>) to bring together Dubai’s community bakers. Wild Peeta has been the main supporters of BakeFestDXB and have generously opened up their venue for us for the second time (how cool is that?!) to sell our stuff.</p>
