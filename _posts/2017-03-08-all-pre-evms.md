<blockquote>The latest avatar of the Electronic Voting Machine is called ‘M3’ and the Election Commission is looking to ramp up its production ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.</blockquote>
<p>EVMs were first used in 1998 so any improvement is welcome.</p>
<p>On technology improvements in the M3:</p>
<blockquote>The M3 comes with digital verification system coded into each machine which is necessary to establish contact between its two component units. This makes it absolutely tamper proof.</blockquote>
<p>Numerous reports of EVM hacks have surfaced over the years, even leading the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/supreme-court-india-voter-verifiable-paper-audit-trails-must-be-used" target="_blank">Supreme Court to order the Voter Verifier Paper Trail (VVPT) system</a> in 2013.</p>
<p>5.5 lakh new M3 EVMs have been ordered already at a cost of Rs. 3,000 crore, to replace an estimated 9 lakh M1 machines. Approval is awaited on adding a third PSU to ramp up manufacturing:</p>
<blockquote>Central Electronics Ltd in Ghaziabad could soon join Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India, sources in the EC confirmed.</blockquote>
