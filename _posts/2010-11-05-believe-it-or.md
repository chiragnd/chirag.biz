<p>One side of me sees a massive festive season. Another sees just another excuse for people here to take massive break, relax and NOT work! (Most places have 8–10 days off in a row) That said, the last couple of days (and nights) have been marked by festivities all around, lights everywhere and the loudest firecrackers at night when you try to wind down for the day.</p>
<p>Pictures were sadly taken with a camera phone since I don’t have a proper camera around at the moment.</p>
<p>And for those of you who don’t know what Diwali is, I’ll leave with the (funny) explanation from Season 3 of <em>The Office</em>.</p>
