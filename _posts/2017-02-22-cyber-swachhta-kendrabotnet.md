<blockquote>“India today joined the distinguished club of countries that have malware-cleaning systems for the use of its citizens. As of now, we have 13 banks and internet service providers using this facility. With the expanding digital footprint in the country, I see a surge in start-ups in the area of cyber security by the end of the year,” said Union IT and Electronics Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at the event here.</blockquote>
<p>Another good element is the launch of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT-In) in the States, rather than just at the Centre.</p>
