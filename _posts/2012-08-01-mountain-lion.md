<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/40dc9-093y8kfjw6kg3wg4l.png"></figure><p>Much like I did with Lion, I picked up the Mountain Lion upgrade to Apple’s OS X the day it was available on the Mac App store. <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/lion-first-impressions#more" target="_blank">I’ve already discussed it before</a>, but this whole download new version of OS while sitting in your room is pretty brilliant. But I’m more amazed when I think of the 3 million downloads at $20. That’s $60 million in sales without a dime in shipping. In 3 days.</p>
<p>In traditional bullet point style, here goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>10.8 is a <em>massive</em> performance upgrade. Everything just seems to run faster, and there are huge improvements to memory management (I use <a href="http://www.rockysandstudio.com/apps/freememory" target="_blank">Free memory</a> to keep an eye on available memory). But there’s more. The return from sleep is brilliant — seconds over what was normally a 4–5 minute return. The other improvement I’m seeing is when I connect over to an external monitor — the resolution shift/adjustments take seconds now as well.</li>
<li>I think <a href="http://growl.info/" target="_blank">Growl</a> probably kicked themselves in the foot (paw?) at some point by going paid, but regardless, the notification center is a great add-on. More apps will naturally integrate themselves, which will make it better. It’s great though that Chrome is Notification center-ready already. Twitter is so-so; it’s nice to get alerts but annoying that to reply it takes me to Twitter web, which isn’t a good UX. (No, don’t ask what a chirag sexy cake is).</li>
</ul>

But as I accidentally discovered, the packages are available within Mountain Lion already. Hmm.</li></ul>

<li>Firing up notification center takes some understanding (a quick google explains it though), but there isn’t a hot key with the magic mouse. I haven’t been bothered by this yet but it would have been nice.</li>
<li>Fonts. I had the same problem with Lion — post the upragde, Chrome’s font rendering went for an absolute toss, and for the font-geek in me, I’m forced to use Safari when I can’t stand it. Let’s hope they fix that quickly.</li>
<li>I like Safari’s zoom-out tab mode. It’s cool. I’m not sure it’s necessarily too useful though — I’ve never thought of it as a problem to navigate tabs, but it is pretty.</li>
<li>Icons seem to have gotten a facelift — well, the Retina Macbook Pro is responsible for that, I’m sure. But it’s nice to see crisper, brighter icons around.</li>
</ul>

<li>The return of the Save As.. is a welcome one for most people I’m sure.</li>
<li>It would seem that I can no longer view the battery life time remaining on the status bar — requiring a click to be able to see this information.</li>
<li>Freeing up an additional 10GB of space post the upgrade? Sold!</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I’m really happy with this upgrade. The performance improvements alone are solid, and notification center is a good answer to a common problem.</p>
<p>Well there you have it. At least I didn’t do another ‘is Mountain Lion worth $20’ with a cost breakdown post, right?</p>
