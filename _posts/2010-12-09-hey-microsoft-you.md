<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li>They should mention that up front somewhere, not in itsy bitsy letters at the bottom</li>
<li>The error message should say so — you need to upgrade to SP2 for example. To me, this reads like Server 2003 is not supported period, which is just infuriating.</li>
<li>Finally, having to download this install using Google Chrome is just absolutely beyond me. (IE 6 on this machine, and IE7 on another one just kept crashing if I attempted to download IE7 and IE8 respectively).</li>
</ul>
<p>So yea, I consider that a fail.</p>
<p>Finally, people should stop building IE only applications so I wouldn’t have to go through this at all.</p>
