This time I decided I would attempt to make a favourite of mine. Ferrero Rocher Cheesecake. This took some imagination and a little bit of research. I finally decided to alter a few recipes which I found to make my own.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates</li>
<li>One jar of Nutella</li>
<li>1 250g packet of Chocolate Digestive Biscuits</li>
<li>100g Butter, melted</li>
<li>1 Tub of Double Cream (300ml)</li>
<li>1 Tub of Cream Cheese (300g Philadelphia)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of Icing Sugar</li>
<li>a handful of chopped roasted Hazelnuts (to decorate)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Line the cheesecake tin with baking parchment</li>
<li>Crush the digestive biscuits in a mixer and add the melted butter into the mixer. Pulse the mixture till combined.</li>
<li>Pour into the cheesecake tin and press down firmly</li>
<li>Whip a bit of the cream with the Philadelphia to soften and remove any lumps.</li>
<li>Whip the rest of the cream in a separate bowl with the icing sugar</li>
<li>Add the softened Philadelphia to whipped cream and mix till just combined</li>
<li>Pour the combined cream cheese mixture into the cheesecake tin, smoothing down with a spatula or spoon.</li>
<li>Spread a layer of Nutella over the cream cheese mixture.</li>
<li>Sprinkle on some roasted chopped hazelnuts</li>
<li>Add one whole Ferrero Rocher per slice of cheesecake. (usually 8/10 slices)</li>
</ol>
<p>Top tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are making it in a cheesecake tin, line the tin with baking parchment</li>
<li>Grease the baking parchment with some butter to make it stick to the inside of the tin</li>
<li>You can make individual cheesecake pots (see picture above)</li>
<li>Press the digestive biscuit base down gently with a spoon or fingers if you like getting messy</li>
<li>Dipping the spoon/spatula in water helps the Nutella layer smooth out</li>
</ul>
<p>I love making cheesecakes almost as much as I love devouring them. I dare you to give this one a try, you will not be disappointed. Happy Cheesecake making!</p>
