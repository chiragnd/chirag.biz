So on the occassion of Diwali, we bring you, live from the naihar kitchens, the <em>Ghughra</em>. Since I try to relate stuff we do to more colloquially known items out here, I suppose you can think of this as perhaps a sweet fatayer.</p>

Not that it can’t be eaten during the year or anything, but well, it just must be on the table during all those diwali get togethers we have around this time. Relish!</p>
