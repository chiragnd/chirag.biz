<p>A really good post on the current standard, or lack thereof, of browsers, and interesting insights into why things like iPhone apps seem to offer much better experiences.</p>
<p>Sachin:</p>
<blockquote>The web as an application platform stinks, and I think this is even more apparent now as we see incredible iPad apps being released. Why are iPad apps, in their initial versions, so much better than websites that have existed for years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>When I started writing this post last week, it was going to declare the end of the web. I’m not quite ready to call it dead, but it’s on thin ice.</blockquote>
