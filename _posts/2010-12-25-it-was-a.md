<p>This post is way overdue (months and months). This was my first attempt to make Black Forest Cupcakes and it was a success! Of course, there were those moments where I walked impatiently in the kitchen looking into the microwave while it was still on to see if the concoction of flour, eggs, cherries, melted chocolate etc was rising up in each cupcake cover. The cakes, surprisingly turned out to be soft and fluffy. Not to boast, but they literally melted in the mouth. Not sure if cupcakes are supposed to be that way, but who cares! I didnâ€™t go with the conventional icing and instead changed it to a very light version of cherry icing. So there you have it, mission accomplished.</p>
<p>P.S. Please note that I am not that grand of a photographer like Dee or Chirag and hence my pictures are sad.</p>
