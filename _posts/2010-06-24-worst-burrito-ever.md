Well, here we are, you pessimistic person you, our first negative review.</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>At the behest of a close friend who had also never tried the place, my first lunch in Philadelphia after three years was at a place creatively called Currito Burrito, right on the??<a href="http://www.drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a>??campus by the residence halls. This was housed in a new food court structure that had come up after I left the city. Oh, the excitement.</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>Curbing my natural instincts to go to Subway — primarily because Subway in the US kicks Subway in the UAE’s behind by a mile and a half — I went for the “new Burrito place that is really good.”</p>
<p>Some considerations later, I went for what they called a Mediterranean Burrito, comprising rice, a Black Bean hummus and some other condiments. I wasn’t overtly impressed with the look and feel, or the way he was actually making my burrito at all. And the burrito, right, let me say it was the worst burrito I’ve had, and that graciously includes??<a href="http://www.naihar.com/black-bean-burritos" target="_blank">my own home-made version</a>.??</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>I don’t really know what else to say except to avoid the place, and particularly the Mediterranean option. The burrito was dry, the rice was…is stuffy an appropriate word? And the flavors just did not work.</p>
