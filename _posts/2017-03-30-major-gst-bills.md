<blockquote>The historic Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime today came a step closer to meet its July 1 target of rollout, with the Lok Sabha approving four supplementary legislations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Central GST Bill, 2017; The Integrated GST Bill, 2017; The GST (Compensation to States) Bill, 2017; and The Union Territory GST Bill, 2017 were passed after negation of a host of amendments moved by the Opposition parties.</blockquote>
<p>Someday I’ll look back and remember how I watched the live stream of much of the debate and the vote, much like the passing of the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/GST-A-look-at-the-changes-proposed-to-the-Constitution-122nd-Amendment-Bill-2014/article14549089.ece" target="_blank">122nd Constitutional Amendment that made GST a reality</a>.</p>
<p>Finance Minster Arun Jaitley’s speech in Lok Sabha addressing various questions raised and before he moved the bills is available <a href="https://medium.com/p/fm-arun-jaitley-speech-in-ls-on-gst-84146da3645f" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
