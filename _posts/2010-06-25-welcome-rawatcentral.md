<p>This should have come out sooner. But I’m sure you will all forgive me, because…well each of you will have a different reason so I’m not going to get into that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.naihar.com/" target="_blank">Naihar</a> is pleased to welcome it’s newest contributor and the UK’s real princess, <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5Aqfneoo1aXT" target="_blank">Dee Rawat</a>. Like I said, this post has come in a little late, so Dee’s already got a head start with two solid posts: her homemade??<a href="http://www.naihar.com/mango-cheesecake-i-just-couldnt-resist-the-te" target="_blank">Mango Cheesecake</a>??(yum!) and a <a href="http://www.naihar.com/bukhara-of-samelsbury" target="_blank">review of Bukhara of Samelsbury</a>??(okay seriously, that cheesecake really looks delicious! Go ahead, click on the link already.). I’m told she also had a fair share to do with the large number of hits the <a href="http://www.naihar.com/bite-sized-demonstration-strawberry-delights" target="_blank">Strawberry bite-size delights post</a> received (including comments from the chef’s themselves).</p>
<p>With successes like these, she requires no introduction. But I thought I should give her one anyway. Welcome aboard!</p>
<p>I’d be amiss (read: dead) if I didn’t mention our other amazing contributors that continue to provide us with finger-licking content and the resulting army of views — a big thanks to <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5fj0bXua0irL" target="_blank">Neelofer</a>, <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5fiRbom5LZYd" target="_blank">Devina</a> &amp; <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5fiYSt6aZLG1" target="_blank">Nikita</a>. You guys rock, just like I do.</p>
