<p><a href="https://thenextweb.com/in/2017/08/09/india-has-blocked-the-internet-archive-nationwide-and-wont-say-why/#.tnw_YD7mfdms" target="_blank">Abhimanyu Ghoshal, writing for The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote>…it’s [sic] latest stunt is perhaps the most audacious to date: blocking the Internet Archive.</blockquote>
<p>Leaving out the cold opening to paint a picture, the problem with the piece is here:</p>
<blockquote>It’s possible that the block is an effort to prevent web users in the country from viewing these documents, including one that lists a number of private companies tasked with seeding and verifying Aadhaar data. It might also be the result of a court order that has nothing to do with censorship — but at this point, there’s no way to know for certain.</blockquote>
<p>Good thing he gave himself an out considering couldn’t resist throwing around a grand total of one speculation — about Aadhaar. As Medianama — the site he references — points out <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2017/08/223-internet-archive-blocked-court-orders-obtained-bollywood-studios/" target="_blank">in a separate piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The orders came following cases filed by Red Chillies Entertainment and Prakash Jha Productions, who filed motions for the block to protect their films, “Jab Harry Met Sejal” and “Lipstick Under My Burkha” respectively. 2,650 URLs were blocked as a part of the order: the exact same list of sites was used by the both the plaintiffs.</blockquote>
<p>What is impressive is that Medianama updated the original piece with 2 different updates to include comments from the Internet Archive, but chose not to add an Update 3, or linking to its separate piece on the actual reasons and the Court orders.</p>
<p>For those curious about what happened, the Court order seems to be in effect for a period of one week.</p>
