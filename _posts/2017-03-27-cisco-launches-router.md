<blockquote>After launch of its India manufacturing operations in October last year, global hardware networking giant <a href="https://techobserver.in/tag/cisco" title=" cisco ( )" target="_blank">Cisco</a> has finally delivered the first made in India router under ‘Make in India’ initiative. As gesture the Cisco handed over the first Made in India Router valued under $1500 to the Union electronics &amp; IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.</blockquote>
