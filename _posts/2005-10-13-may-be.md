<p>May be this is what I wanted,<br>To stay in peace away from you,<br>It’s sad, it’s true, may be things are best now that we are through.</p>
<p>May be I am happy that it got no further,<br>I did not have to confront my feelings for you.<br>Every time my mind repeats the scene, I get firmer,<br>May be this time I will forget you.</p>
<p>May be I should have told you that I love you.<br>May be its best if I dont pretend,<br>Everything hurts so much right now,<br>I wish may be we’d never met.</p>
<p>Yet it isnt all your fault.<br>I set my self up for the fall.<br>And though thinking may be, may be makes it better,<br>There really was no may be there at all.</p>
