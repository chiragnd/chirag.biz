<p>My first time in the much hyped candy store, <a href="http://www.thedubaimall.com/en/shop/candylicious" target="_blank">Candylicious</a> located at <a href="http://www.thedubaimall.com/en/" target="_blank">Dubai Mall</a> was nothing but sheer excitement at looking at everything candy and chocolate — from flavored lollipops to chocolate shaped stars to tubes filled with gummy bears reaching the ceiling — it was pure ecstasy. I’m a huge fan of desserts but particular ones and I love my candy. So going on an empty stomach to a candy store really made me go berserk and buy things I didn’t want. In other words — impulsive shopping.??</p>
<p>But hey, do go check out the store if you haven’t (because half of Dubai’s population can be located at that store). It’s just about awesome. :D</p>
