<p>I have my reservations (I believe I tend to be vocal about them) about Microsoft, but there’s no denying that they were revolutionary for the PC industry in terms of reaching it out to the masses.</p>
<p>There’s also no denying that Ballmer just annoys me. I’m not really sure why. Maybe because his portrayal in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0168122%2F&amp;ei=HyL9T_epBMaGswayv-mjBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEyrXWehCYAIYhKg4en4t7dRxj2A" target="_blank">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a> made him sound like an unimaginitive frat boy riding a wave (no offense to frat boys..or waves). I mean…</p>
<blockquote>But we are not going to let any piece of this [go uncontested to Apple],” Ballmer shouted. “Not the consumer cloud. Not hardware software innovation. We are not leaving any of that to Apple by itself. Not going to happen. Not on our watch.</blockquote>
<p>Shouted. Interesting.</p>
<p>I get his point but if they’re going to now drive all their energy towards chasing Apple, they’ll never get there. Apple is known for their secrecy anyway, and they might get lucky but they’ll purely be playing the chasing game.</p>
<p>This is hot on the heels of news that Microsoft is looking at its first loss-quarter since 1986. A <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/26660666648/microsofts-financial-black-hole" target="_blank">holy shit moment</a> indeed.</p>
