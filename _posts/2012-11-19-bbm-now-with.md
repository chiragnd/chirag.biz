<blockquote>..RIM today announced BBM version 7, a free update for the globally popular mobile social network, which will allow customers to make free voice calls to other BBM customers around the world over a Wi-FiÂ® connection.</blockquote>

<p>Ofcourse, it remains to be seen how carriers respond to this.</p>
