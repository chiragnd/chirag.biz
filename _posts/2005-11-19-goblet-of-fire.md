<p>Harry Potter and GoF: Overall 4.75 stars</p>
<p>Very well made, indeed, considering they had to squeeze twice the size compared to PoA in the same time frame.</p>
<p>I wasn’t too crazy about the ending…they could’ve spent more time explaining and less time sending the Durmstrangs and Beauxbatons away. Ah well.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort was pretty well done, as were the three tasks.</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra. Green light.</p>
