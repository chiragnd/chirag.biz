<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/59003-0ln-z93l3hnepnz23.png"></figure><p>Just saw the <a href="http://blog.picplz.com/day/2012/06/01/" target="_blank">note from Picplz</a> saying they intend on shutting down in one month. I’m guessing they’ve figured it just makes sense to get out of the business with an inconvenience to a subset of users than fight the growing monopoly that is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100318398827991" target="_blank">Facebook+Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve been a user for some time, I’m not an avid user as I tend to just post pictures here instead. However, I thought the least they could have done was to provide a link allowing users to download multiple pics or say 30–50 at a time, which I’m sure wouldn’t have killed their time. Their solution of ‘we’re providing a download link for each individual picture’ is just…annoying.</p>
<p><em>Update, June 16:</em> While I doubt my blogpost had anything to do with it, Picplz came out a couple of weeks later with a single archive link of all pictures, which they intend to keep available until September 3. Yay.</p>
