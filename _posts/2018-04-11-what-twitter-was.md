[Jean MacDonald](https://macgenie.micro.blog/2018/04/10/a-guide-to.html):
> I have several friends in “real life” who started as Twitter buddies. But over the years, Twitter has become something I don’t recognize anymore, a place where hate and intolerance and crass commercialism have found a welcoming home.

As a side note, a nice insight into understanding micro.blog as a Twitter user—how they're same in some ways, and how they're different. 

Her Twitter experience though is not far away from mine; some of my closest friendships & collaborations have their origins on the network, but ... here we are now.

Jean doesn't get into this much but a long-standing problem with Twitter is how they've stifled third party development, [over](https://blog.chirag.biz/goodbye-twimbow-33be1b392cce), [over](https://blog.chirag.biz/more-twitter-api-restrictions-now-for-win8-b14d5ba783fa) and [over](http://apps-of-a-feather.com) again. I mean, even a service like [LinkedIn doesn't—well, can't—really integrate with Twitter](https://blog.chirag.biz/twitter-vs-linkedin-529c67a84ebc).

The 'philosophy' of increasingly closing off the network to the outside world or the open Web at large has been seeping into other aspects of Twitter's culture as an organization & a platform. The last few real Twitter apps are now bending under this weight.

Considering [Facebook isn't in a particularly great place currently](http://www.chirag.biz/2018/04/08/massaging-egos-facebook.html) either, hello to an free-er, open-er Web. And hello, Micro.blog.
