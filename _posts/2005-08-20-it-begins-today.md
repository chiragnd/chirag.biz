<p>A lot has happened in past week<br>Enough said, done to make me weep<br>I’m trying, and I’ve gotta be strong<br><br>What I’m fighting for can only be won this way<br>Every time I lapse, I remember the face<br>The one sure thing that is my strength<br>Every time I lapse, I remember the voice<br>The one sure thing that gets me up<br><br>My breathing is slowly, but surely becoming regular<br>And I wait until I again hit the crest<br>Sitting at the bottom of the trough<br>There’s only one way to go from here<br>Up, up and up.</p>
