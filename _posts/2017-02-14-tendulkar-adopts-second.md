<blockquote>Tendulkar has sanctioned over Rs 4 crore from his MPLAD fund for development of Donja. The amount will be spent on development of a new school building, a water Supply scheme that would provide potable water to each household, concrete roads and a sewage line attached to the same, a press release stated.</blockquote>
<p>Donja is in Osmanabad, Maharashta.</p>
<p>We haven’t heard all that much recently about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, where MPs ‘adopt’ a village and provide funds to improve conditions. Good to hear that Tendulkar, who is a Rajya Sabha MP and <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/report/sachin-rekha-have-less-than-6-per-cent-attendance-in-rajya-sabha/20151218.htm" target="_blank">receives flak</a> on his contribution in/to Parliament, moving on to a second village, after Puttamraju Kandriga (Andhra Pradesh).</p>
