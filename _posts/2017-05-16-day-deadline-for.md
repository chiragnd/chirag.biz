</figure><p>All NGOs have been given a final opportunity to file their annual returns within 30 days, ending 14 June 2017. No compounding fee will be imposed within this deadline.</p>
<p>Numerous NGOs are under scrutiny for not filing returns from FY2010–11 to FY2014–15. NGOs that do not file returns will not be granted renewal of registration.</p>
