Boasting authentic food, the real reason I wanted to try it out was because someone who tried out my <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13" target="_blank">favorite pizzeria in Dubai</a> (which has since shut down) said he had liked Il Forno better.</p>
<p>Not one to take criticism poorly, I tried it.</p>
<p>One bite in and Il Forno fell into the category of just another pizza place. They’re not bad, but they’re not great either. I only tried their pizza — I went with their garlic-and-olive-oil option — and felt mostly like I was eating a couple-hours-old manakish. The crust was overwhelming, didn’t feel too fresh and the cheese was your usual unfrozen mozzarella. The iced tea I had with the pizza was your standard run-of-the-mill restaurant iced tea and not brewed or such either.</p>

The staff were friendly though and while I’ve only tried their pizzas on a couple different occasions, it’s been with the same results.</p>
<p>For those following closely, the search continues for good pizza in the UAE. There are some <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-mamma-rossella" target="_blank">I like</a>, some I don’t and others I despise (and therefore, haven’t really visited since the start of this blog). But I’ve received some <a href="http://foodiva.net/2011/07/dubais-best-pizza-emporio-armani-caffe/" target="_blank">good suggestions</a> and will post up once I get a chance to try them out. All in all, Il Forno is not going to be my favorite pizza anytime soon.</p>
