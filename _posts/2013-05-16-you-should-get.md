<p>Funny take on the marriage question. My favorite bit:</p>
<blockquote>You are putting so much drama and telling, ‘Father is getting old and his health problems are also there. What if “something happens to him” without seeing your marriage?’. Like this and all you will say means what to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is like saying ‘If you don’t kill yourself now, I will die. Now you choose what you want to do’</blockquote>
