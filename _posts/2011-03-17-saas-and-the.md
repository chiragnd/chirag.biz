<p>My post on the <a href="http://www.amaeya.com/" target="_blank">AMAEYA</a> Corporate blog:</p>
<blockquote>After attending yet another <a href="http://www.cloudcomputinglive.com/mea" target="_blank">Cloud Computing Conference</a>, where I had the chance to interact with various IT professionals on this high focus subject, I felt more or less that the same questions are getting asked over and over again.</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Is Cloud just a fad?</li>
<li>How secure is the Cloud?</li>
<li>But I don’t want to put my data on the Cloud, now what?</li>
<li>The Cloud’s not for me because I have enough servers and computing power.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>I can’t attempt to answer all the questions in one go, but I wanted to talk about something that most (at least in the regional Cloud Computing talks I’ve been to so far) don’t seem to fully address.</blockquote>
