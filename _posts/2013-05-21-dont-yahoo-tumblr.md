<p>It hasn’t been all that long since <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/37096953036/life-after-posterous" target="_blank">Posterous was acquired</a> (well, acuihired) by Twitter and I dealt with the closing of one of my favorite publishing platforms.* So <a href="https://twitter.com/chiragnd/status/335277106286170112" target="_blank">my surprise</a> — and subsequent introspection at my choices — at Yahoo’s acquisition of Tumblr was not surprising.</p>
<p>Acquisitions are tricky little things. Yahoo themselves, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Yahoo!" target="_blank">have a huge list of them</a>, and the track record isn’t something to write home about just yet. But over the last few months, I do feel that Marissa Meyer’s moves have been largely positive towards Yahoo’s own spirit. The Tumblr announcement itself came in parallel with the long, long, long awaited <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2013/05/20/a-better-brighter-flickr/" target="_blank">major redesign to emancipated child Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>And I will admit the initial signs are good. Unlike Posterous’ announcement which carried the rather dangerous ‘We’ll give you a way to export all your sites’, <a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/50902111638/tumblr-yahoo" target="_blank">Yahoo’s announcement</a> contained a very encouraging:</p>
<blockquote>We promise not to screw it up.</blockquote>
<p>Also worth reading is employee #2 <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/05/20/one-person-product" target="_blank">Marco Arment’s thoughts on the acquisition</a> and Tumblr as a product.</p>
<p>I realize the title of this post is a little condescending of the term Yahoo, and probably is not the Yahoo under Meyer. But I also really hope they don’t Yahoo Tumblr.</p>
