<p>It goes something like this*:</p>
<blockquote>W: ‘I’m not one of those people’.<br>M: ‘One of what people?’</blockquote>
<p>You know, the kind of people who wouldn’t drink coffee at a petrol station at all, let alone on a first date. Ok, so there are principles involved.</p>
<blockquote>M: ‘But it’s not just any coffee, it’s…’ coffee of a very specific brand.<br>W: Hmmm, but is it organic?<br>M: Yes, my princess, they have organic options<br>W: Oooh, you’re a classy guy.</blockquote>
<p>Not that I was dying to try it or anything, but now I’m totally off this brand of coffee. I mean, what. Just, what. How. WHY?!</p>
<p>Folks, please chime in. Is petrol station coffee a turn on for a first date as long as it has an organic option?</p>
<p>The Coco Nails ad is starting to sound pretty good.</p>
