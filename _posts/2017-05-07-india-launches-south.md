<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">GSLV-F09 / GSAT-9 Source: ISRO</figcaption></figure><p>The 2,230 kg South Asia satellite (GSAT-9) was successfully launched using India’s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F09). The launch was accomplished from the Second Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR at Sriharikota.</p>
<p>The GSLV-F09 used 4 liquid propellant strap-on motors, each carrying 42 tons of fuel. The Satellite hit Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) in 17 minutes after liftoff at 16:57 GST. The Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan, Karnataka has assumed control of the Satellite.</p>
<p>The GSAT is currently orbiting the Earth with a perigee (closest point) of 169km and orbital inclination w.r.t the equator of 20.65 degrees. It will be raised to the final circular Geostationary Orbit (GSO) in a few days before being commissioned into service.</p>
<p>The GSAT-9 has 12 Ku band transponders and took three years to fabricate with a total cost of Rs. 230 crore. Its two solar arrays will generate 3.5 kilowatts of power.</p>
<p>It will be used facilitate DTH television, VSAT links, tele-education, tele-medicine and disaster management support, and is shared by India and 7 South Asian nations.</p>
