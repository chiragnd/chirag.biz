</figure><p>Hi all, I wanted to introduce <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/talk/home" target="_blank">Drishti talk</a>, our podcast covering informative discourse around topics that matter to the Indian electorate.</p>
<p>To this end, I invite you to please <a href="https://ekdrishti.in" target="_blank">follow our publication here with a Medium account</a> or on <a href="http://twitter.com/ekdrishti" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you prefer. Tell us your topics of interest, or topics you have expertise on and would like a platform to share.</p>
<p>We think there are enough political debates — particularly shouting matches — out there, and our focus is on informing the Indian voter by puttings facts and direction in context and trying to understand real outcomes.</p>
<p>The general format will be free-flowing conversation (30–45 minutes long) that is both constructive and positive around the India story and hopefully sensitive topics that are lacking informative discussion.</p>
<p>You can listen to our podcast using:</p>
