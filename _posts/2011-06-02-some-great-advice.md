<p>Saw an <a href="http://twitter.com/AtulChitnis/status/75773775345496064" target="_blank">interesting tweet</a> on my timeline this morning relating to first day at a first job and advice surrounding it. This became a great list of 20 tips (well, 19, since there was no 13th tip) that I think I would recommend anyone read — and in some cases, not just on their first job.</p>
<p>I may not be a veteran, but I can already see how this advice would have been incredibly useful. While I will confess I put a couple of them into practice at my first job, dang I wish someone had told me about the remaining 18. :)</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/atulchitnis" target="_blank">@AtulChitnis</a>!</p>
