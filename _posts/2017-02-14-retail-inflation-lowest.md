<p><a href="http://in.mobile.reuters.com/article/idINKBN15S1BB" target="_blank">Shailesh Andrade, reporting for Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Consumer prices rose by an annual 3.17 percent last month — their slowest pace since January 2012, when the government launched the current index series.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 3.22 percent from a year earlier, compared with December’s 3.41 percent increase.</blockquote>
<p>The article attributes the higher than expected drop to demonetization. The data, though, seems to indicate that while demonetization may have supplemented the decline, it is not the root cause — there has been a near consistent decrease in inflation since 2014, and would imply other economic and governance reasons are also playing a part. The trendline therefore makes for positive reading.</p>
<p>Since July 2016, which is the peak 6% seen last calendar year and 3 months pre-demonetization, it has dropped consistently month-to-month to end at 3.17% in January.</p>
