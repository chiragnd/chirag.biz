<p>Gorgeous track.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" target="_blank">Apple’s Macbook reveal</a> uses this as its background score, which might seem like an obvious choice considering they went gold. But what’s even better is the artist represents the song with three models in the video, against the three available with this Macbook’s release — silver, space gray and gold. Talk about attention to detail.</p>
