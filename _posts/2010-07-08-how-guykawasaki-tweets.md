<li>
<strong>Question:</strong> How can you follow so many people?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> I don’t read the timelines of all the people that I follow. Instead, I only deal with @s, Directs, and tweets that contain “guykawasaki” and “alltop.” I am not reading everything everyone I follow tweets, but I answer almost every @ and Direct.</li>
<li>
<strong>Question:</strong> Then why do you follow everyone? <br><strong>Answer:</strong> I follow everyone for two reasons: first, common courtesy; second, so that anyone can send a Direct to me. I like Direct messages because they are so much more efficient than email.</li>

<strong>Update</strong>: no change.</li>
