<blockquote>Government code-breakers are working on deciphering a message that has remained a secret for 70 years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It was found on the remains of a carrier pigeon that was discovered in a chimney, in Surrey, having been there for decades.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is thought the contents of the note, once decoded, could provide fresh information from World War II.</blockquote>
