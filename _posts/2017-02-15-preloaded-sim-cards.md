<p>Launched via the Department of Tourism &amp; Culture, BSNL will now offer tourists arriving on an e-visa the option to pick up a SIM card pre-loaded with Rs. 50 talk time, and 50 MB of data activated immediately. Tourists will have to provide BSNL with a copy of their e-visa and the first page of their passport on arrival to avail the service.</p>
<p>The facility was launched at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport’s T3 terminal, and will soon cover all 15 international airports.</p>
