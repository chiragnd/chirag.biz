<p>The first (and only, thankfully) time that happened was when I visited <em>Foul W Hummus</em> a couple of weeks ago to sample and photograph their delicious hummus. Now that I think about it, I’m surprised it hasn’t more often considering my (borderline crazy) fascination with taking multiple shots of food at restaurants and eateries.</p>
<p>Right, let’s get the disclaimer out first: I love hummus. Part of my life’s mission involves hunting for decent hummus* — and don’t scoff, enough outlets get it wrong for me to include it in a mission statement. That’s how much I adore this awesome chickpea creation. So when I spotted a little outlet in Barsha named after it, I was intrigued enough.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc08836" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/708d927b43.jpg"></figure><p><em>Foul W Hummus</em> is a fantastic testament to the ‘less is more’ philosophy. With a simple menu comprising three main items — Foul, Hummus &amp; Falafel (and related variations) only, they may only do a few things, but they do them right.</p>
<p>This is particularly true when it comes to their hummus; the only word that comes to mind is <em>addictive</em>! They seem to have their proportions perfectly right — just enough creaminess and just enough tahini — to always leave us licking the edges of the containers every time we go. They also keep a constantly-on-the-stove container of boiled whole chickpeas to add that perfect warmth into each serving.</p>

Heck, I’ve even got cousins all the way in South America craving their hummus months after their last visit (during which, mind, we made 4 trips to the place in a week). We’re not the only ones either; stop by on a Friday morning and you’ll barely be able to stand in there — which will only make you glad they get their orders done quickly!</p>

I will admit I’ve had better falafels and foul elsewhere, but theirs is still among the fresher ones available around town. It’s just…their hummus is so enjoyable, the others pale a little in comparison. We’ve also tried their fatteh — which is yummy as well except it dries up quickly, so I don’t recommend getting it unless you’re eating it there, or in the car on your way home. (Edit: A subsequent visit indicated that they’ve solved that problem, so take it away!)</p>
