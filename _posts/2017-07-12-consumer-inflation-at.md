<blockquote>Consumer inflation in June cooled to a new record-low of 1.54 per cent, driven by a drop in food and oil prices, government data showed on Wednesday. In May consumer price inflation stood at 2.18 per cent, which was also a record low.</blockquote>
<p>This follows a consistent decline in inflation rates since 2014, and record decreases since the start of January 2017.</p>
