<p>Say hello to the newest kid on the block (wow, I need new band references) and our very own resident food explorer, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Siddhi_D" target="_blank">Siddhi</a>!</p>
<p>A self-confessed lover of food that’s been plated well, Siddhi is known for snapping up dishes all around town (and beyond), and starts off with the extremely craving-inducing dessert all the way from <em>C’est ici Brasserie </em>in London.</p>
<p>Presenting the Evil mud cake with a dark Belgian chocolate center and chamomile ice cream. Quite a mouthful. She claims it took her mere seconds to devour!</p>
