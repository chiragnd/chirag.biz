<figure><img alt="Dark_chocolate_mousse" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/1e3eb5bb00.jpg"></figure><p>This was made by dad at home. Whenever I make a mousse cake (last attempt was strawberry mousse cake), it never turns out like this (read: messed up). The one made by dad has the perfect consistency, the taste, even they way it’s cut and presented looks awesome. It was garnished with white chocolate- for some reason (till date) it looks like cheese to me :)</p>
