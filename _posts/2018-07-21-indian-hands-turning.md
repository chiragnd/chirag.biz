[Ketan Thakkar, reporting for the Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/indian-hands-turning-wheels-of-global-auto-companies/amp_articleshow/65077276.cms):
> The Indian R&D setup for Mercedes-Benz has metamorphosed from a tiny division with 20 staffers in Bengaluru, the IT capital of India, a couple of decades ago into a powerhouse of 5,000 engineers that is contributing significantly to new-age technology. The company is already preparing to double its office space as the scope of work expands significantly.

Additionally:

> Ford India said in 2016 it would invest $195 million to set up a global technology and business centre in Chennai to leverage India as an innovation hub.

> Bosch, the worldâ€™s leading auto component maker, has its biggest R&D centre in India. [...] For years, Bosch has used India as a test bed for solutions to be adapted in other emerging markets. Likewise, the R&D team of Renault Nissan Technology Business Centre India is helping the Chinese R&D team in developing a small electric car.
