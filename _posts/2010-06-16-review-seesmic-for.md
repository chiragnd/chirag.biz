<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/2a712-0ptbpuz3zoe68rcrx.jpg"></figure><p>The awesome people at <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">Seesmic</a> finally got around to launching their <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone application</a> last week.</p>
<p>I’ve been a fan of Seesmic from rather early days. To me, they edged out <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a> as the Desktop Twitter client to have at the time, having launched support for multiple accounts and integrating <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> support before anyone else did. Since then I’ve moved on to <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">Seesmic Web</a>(I’d recommend it any day considering it doesn’t use Adobe AIR. But I digress…)</p>
<p>I’ll leave the app comparison for another day, but I think Seesmic’s <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone app</a>’s first rendition is quite good overall.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about the app was the seemingly blazing response time, both in terms of loading new information and response using the touchscreen. By this I mean that a lot of apps I use (I’m not talking just Twitter apps) are effectively hung until their update/reload is complete — this does not seem to be the case here. While I wait for the latest tweets to be updated, I can still navigate around the app freely.</p>
<p>Let’s talk unique features. First up is the panel view. This is a fairly neat way of using one app to encompass multiple services. The panels are cleanly organized and easy to navigate. You can even setup a panel for a specific twitter search you follow, making it accessible with one click or swirl. You can navigate between panels by either using the panel button or merely side-swapping them. I thought it was cool that when you are looking at the panel, the faded screenshot is an actual live version of the feed on that panel.</p>
<p>Currently, Seesmic’s app allows you to quickly sign in to your <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.ping.fm/" target="_blank">Ping.fm</a> accounts. Sure there is a facebook app, but from a “feed” point of view, Seesmic does a good job. I will not be surprised to hear additional services being integrated, least of all <a href="http://www.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, which Seesmic recently incorporated into their Web client. Seesmic also integrates with Evernote, allowing you to send tweets directly to <a href="https://www.evernote.com/Login.action?targetUrl=/Home.action" target="_blank">Evernote</a> (in addition to e-mailing them) if you want to save them. Seesmic also has a separate ReTweet tab in the main window, allowing you to view all twitter-style RTs in your timeline as a separate feed.</p>
<p>In comparison to other clients I’ve used though, I see a few lacking features.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d have thought that it would have the ability for app sync, at least with Seesmic’s Web client &amp;mdash for unread tweets, messages and the like. Seesmic’s app is also missing the conversation view, which is bizarre considering this is a standard feature on other apps and Seesmic themselves introduced this on their Web client. It is almost infuriating if you’re trying to track back on a conversation if you have to keep tapping the ‘in reply to’ button to see each tweet. This should have been covered from the get-go.</p>
<p>I also miss having unread counts. This is probably more or less a luxury feature, but I think we as a crowd are just used to having that. I’m perfectly okay with not knowing this for the regular feed, but not having this for @-replies and DMs is unnerving. They also did not include in-line previews (which adds clicks, not desirable on a phone app).</p>
<p>Having said that, I’m quite happy with their first version. I can’t be impressed enough with the speed of the app, and for a first run, they’ve done a good job. In my history with <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">Seesmic</a>, I find that they listen to their users and are quite dynamic in terms of releasing new features, so I expect the same to carry over to their iPhone app. If that happens, don’t be surprised if Seesmic’s <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone app</a> becomes the go-to app for aggregating social networking, beyond just <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">twitter</a>.</p>
