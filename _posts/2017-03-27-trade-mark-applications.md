<p>The time taken for trade mark examination has been reduced to less than one month, down from 13 months. As of February 2017, 28,889 applications are pending for examination, while 7.92 lakh applications are pending at all stages, due to lack of manpower according to the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the new Trade Mark Rules 2017 were introduced. Trade mark applications now require 8 forms (down from 74), and a 50% incentive for startups. The entire process can now be completed via e-filing and video conference support is available.</p>
