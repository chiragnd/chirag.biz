I had to give it a try, it being mango season and all that. (Watch this space for nice mango season!)</p>
<p>I gave it a shot and was fairly impressed with the results. I deviated a little away from the recipe itself.</p>
<p>End result: a delicious (and quite filling) salad. It could have used a bit more lemon for some extra zing, and I probably should have waited for it to chill before downing it.</p>
