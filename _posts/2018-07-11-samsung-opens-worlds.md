[VISHWAM SANKARAN, writing for The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/asia/2018/07/10/samsung-opens-worlds-largest-mobile-phone-factory-in-india/):
> The new plant – located in the industrial city of Noida – will help Samsung gradually double its current annual production capacity in India from 67 million phones to 120 million in the next three years. The factory is also expected to provide at least 1,000 more local jobs.

This comes not long after news earlier this year that [Apple is ramping up production of iPhones](http://www.chirag.biz/2018/06/27/production-of-madeinindia.html), [Xiaomi plans to add 3 factories](https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-setting-three-new-smartphone-factories-india-meet-demand) & [Oppo will be setting up a $320m manufacturing facility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/oppo-gets-green-nod-to-set-up-manufacturing-unit-in-noida/articleshow/62006240.cms). India's smartphone market grew 14% last year with 127 million units shipped.
