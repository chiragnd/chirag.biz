</figure><p>Following <a href="https://medium.com/u/5c6977d2a94f" target="_blank">M.G. Siegler</a>’s yearly ritual, here’s my home screen as of the first day of 2017. Most of these are fairly obvious, but I’ll add some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>WhatsApp/Social apps + photos + google maps are pretty much no brainers.</li>
<li>I don’t why Apple News is still here, I never open it.</li>
<li>At some point, I’ll dissolve Reminders and stick with just the one to-do app (2Do).</li>
<li>Yes, Outlook is current email client of choice on iOS.</li>
<li>Messages is blowing up thanks to all the places who have my mobile number and insisted on wishing me a Happy 2017 #iFeelSoPopular</li>
<li>MyFitnessPal is pretty much on its way out since the arrival of the Apple Watch. Granted, its purpose was altogether different, but my zeal to track everything I eat died about 45 days after I started.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you in 2018.</p>
