<p>An interview with the man behind one of my favorite sauces of all time (and something you can’t find in Dubai..yet). Love this quote:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi-tran-20130414-story.html" target="_blank">David Tran, founder of Huy Fong Foods Inc.</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Hot sauce must be hot. If you don’t like it hot, use less. We don’t make mayonnaise here.</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>Revenue grows about 20% a year even with all the competition. Huy Fong Foods has never spent a dollar on advertising.</blockquote>
