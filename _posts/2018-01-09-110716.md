<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I had not noticed that the dock icons no longer have labels until I compared to last year’s homescreen.</figcaption></figure><p>Continuing <a href="https://medium.com/u/5c6977d2a94f" target="_blank">M.G. Siegler</a>’s tradition, my homescreen kicking off 2018. Not to worry, it was screenshot’d on January 1.</p>
<p>Outside of the obvious change to screen size, <a href="https://blog.chirag.biz/home-screen-2017-971367b89fff" target="_blank">compared to 2017</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve switched back to the default mail client after some trouble with Outlook on iOS.</li>
<li>Overcast makes the home screen with podcasts—both listening and creating—taking on a prominence last year.</li>
<li>The social media folder gets a move towards the bottom row for easier thumb access</li>
<li>My recent foray into HomeKit products means Home gets some attention</li>
<li>Apple Pay arriving to my part of the world means the Wallet says hello.</li>
<li>Workout things moved away as I continue to track movement, but open history way less</li>
<li>Been wanting to experiment with Halide all the more</li>
<li>Calculator became a control center action during 2017. The move of control center to the more inconvenient top right has affected this ever so slightly, but I just find myself using Spotlight for basic computation.</li>
<li>I <em>still</em> don’t know why Apple News hasn’t left my home screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until next year.</p>
