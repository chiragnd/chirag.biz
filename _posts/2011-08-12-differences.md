<p>It continually amazes me to see the kind of creativity that comes out of American movies and TV. As I finally watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/" target="_blank">Sucker Punch</a> this week, this was more evident than ever.<br><br>There is so much creativity in the telling of this story. When I compare that against the real run of the mill rubbish we see in bollywood or on Indian tv…I quite literally, have no words.</p>
<p>I think that, in the Bollywood paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>a movie like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/" target="_blank">Sucker Punch</a> wouldn’t have been conceptualized</li>
<li>if we assume for a second that it could have been, no one would have been ready to fund it</li>
<li>if it had been funded, not one ‘mainstream’ish actor would have found the script worthy enough (and)</li>
<li>if one had, they probably couldn’t actually have pulled it off</li>
<li>very few people would have gone to watch it</li>
<li>some politician would have opposed the way young girls were portrayed, and possibly, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCwQqQIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fentertainment%2Fbollywood%2Fnews-interviews%2FPending-preview-Punjab-bans-Aarakshan%2Farticleshow%2F9564070.cms&amp;ei=J3tFToHREI_PsgaP5civBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm2sYtX8W0k0nhIjrhg-8M9-iQmw" target="_blank">banned it</a>
</li>
<li>All in all, it would have been a big enough mess to deter anyone from even voicing the idea</li>
</ul>
<p>On 100% of current Indian television, we still haven’t gotten past the ‘oh-my-god my mother-in-law is insane’ storyline.</p>
<p>It’s sad really.</p>
