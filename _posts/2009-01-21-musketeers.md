<p>So three years and counting and here I am againâ€¦</p>
<p>Thanks GCJ for reminding me I had a blog out there somewhere, and starting the revolution. No promises on keeping this updated though.</p>
<p>Much like one of my favorite TV characters, my life currently revolves around my leg. And tons of sarcasm. You should always be careful what you wish for.</p>
