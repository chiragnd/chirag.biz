<p>I’ve been a Posterous advocate for some time now and my loyalty to the platform only grew the more I used it. It wasn’t without its problems (themes, for a start), but when it came to posting & sharing, Posterous stood out on platform and features. I ran four different blogs on Posterous — what-was-this-blog, food, corporate and more recently, a collection of pictures — and converted a few people to it as well.</p>
<p>Something I’m yet to see in any other platform is how well Posterous managed sharing. The ability for group blogs to have posts shared to a group account and people’s personal accounts was pretty solid, not to mention Posterous’ autoposting capabilities. For example, I never once manually uploaded a picture to my Flickr in over two years but I have a full photo history there.</p>
<p>Sadly, their Twitter acquisition has changed all of this.</p>

As Twitter tends to do, they hired the Posterous team for talent, which is great and I’m really happy for the guys too — I’ve followed some of them and know them to be driven individuals [who care about their products](http://www.chirag.biz/2012/07/07/how-we-ran.html).

<p>But I also know that Posterous will not develop new features for the foreseeable future. This is a problem in and of itself. What’s more, existing things are starting to break (or being intentionally deactivated, I’m not really sure) and there’s no one supporting that.</p>
<p>At first I thought my big question would be where do I go. Oddly enough, that decision didn’t take long, but I learnt that the real question was how.</p>
<p>Wordpress is the only platform that has a Posterous importer that actually works but I had/have no interest in moving there.* I have no inclination to maintain a self-hosted break-fix blog and .com tends to be a little limited with the kind of tweaks I like to have. Plus, my blog is a lot about bits and pieces, thoughts and observations, a link here, a picture there and for that, Tumblr actually does a significantly better job, while managing the environment for me. So this is where I am today.</p>
<p>In fun timing, Tumblr’s <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/36598494153/top-10" target="_blank">recent post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Tumblr has broken into the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/p-19UtqE8ngoZbM" target="_blank">Top 10 sites</a> in the U.S., and now has a worldwide audience of 170 million people.</blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve moved my blogs and have started a shutdown of the old. The blog & feed URL will stay in case there are people that do actually read along.</p>
<p>At the rate the migration occurred, I think I will be annoyed enough to write out a post talking about how this was accomplished, because it is in fact turning out to be a rather woeful experience. More on that later.</p>
<p>To Posterous. The platform that was.</p>
<p>Update, 15 Feb 2013: As expected, <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous" target="_blank">Posterous will shut down April 30</a>.</p>
<p>–<br>*For the record, I do think that Wordpress is one of the strongest content/blogging platforms out there, it’s just not for me.</p>
