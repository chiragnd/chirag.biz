If you need a chocolate fix, you really need to look no further. The cake was dripping chocolate from every pore, and was rather fresh. I placed the order a day in advance and as promised I got a fresh cake in the morning.</p>
<p>The only caveat was the writing on the top — the way it was written didn’t exactly match up what I drew up in store the previous day; somehow that didn’t translate to the place where the cake was made and delivered from (the lady told me it wasn’t done at the store in barsha). That said, the birthday girl loved the cake and the golden foil was a very nice touch indeed!</p>
<p>I picked up this cake from the Chocoa just behind Mall of the Emirates.</p>
