Let’s not forget the crispy??nachos to go with them. Oh, and the fajitas, burritos, quesedillas smothered in cheese, beans and sour cream.??Divine.??</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>With??Spanish influences on their??cuisine, Mexican food uses a lot of corn (think nachos), peppers (think jalapeno) and beans in a variety of different ways. And??<a href="http://www.ontheborder.com/" target="_blank">On The Border</a>??doesn’t make it any easier to choose!</p>

<p>With their varied menu concentrating on salads, appetisers, and different types of mexican wraps, you can be assured to spend a good amount of time pondering over what to order. Many of the dishes on the menu can be made into vegetarian options and they aren’t fussy about it.??It’s a must to try their guacamole live. Freshest ingredients, made to perfection live in front of you — it’s a treat for the eyes, and the tongue. Every dish is made with impeccable perfection, served in good time, and for sure you will not end up with??a soggy taco. The drinks and mocktails are refreshing and fruity, and the best for a hot summer’s day. Service is good, the staff is friendly and do dont hover over your table all the time, but are attentive and knowledgable.??</p>
<p>??</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ontheborder.com/" target="_blank">On The Border</a>??is a great casual dining experience for all Mexican food lovers. Soak up the bright atmosphere, be the noisiest in the crowd and no one will mind, this place offers something for everyone. What sets??<a href="http://www.ontheborder.com/" target="_blank">On The Border</a>??apart from other Mexican restaurants is their ability to stick to true Mexican taste and yet provide their fun, quirky personal touches!</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>Oh, and we did not have place for dessert.. so another review once we get upto it.</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>As they say in Mexico, Buen provecho!</p>
