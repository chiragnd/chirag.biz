<p>Very, very talented. If you like it, I also recommend you check out his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5WB-p-QBJc" target="_blank">Pirates of the Carribean rendition</a>, from when he was even younger.</p>
<p>Credit to someone who has no online presence. (Yes I know, beats me too).</p>
<p>Update: Loving his rendition of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WCM4CV5Iw" target="_blank">Super Mario theme</a> too!</p>
