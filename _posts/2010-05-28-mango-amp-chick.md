<figure><img alt="Mango" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/a5a661276d.jpg"></figure><p>After looking at the mouth-watering Mango and curried chick pea salad captured in Chirag’s <a href="http://www.naihar.com/mango-and-curried-chickpea-salad" target="_blank">post</a>, I decided to try my hand at it. So with the help of my mom, I marched into the kitchen with laptop displaying the recipe. <br> What happened next was a blur of cumin seeds, coriander, mangoes, chickpeas, mom telling me (okay okay, screaming) for almost breaking the mini-blender (I WAS EXCITED, OKAY? Hmph) and spinach leaves. And the end result as you can see is the pic! I have to give credit to my mom. She did most of it…I only stirred in the spices, onion and squeezed out the lemon.</p>
<p>P.S. Not the greatest pic but yea…</p>
