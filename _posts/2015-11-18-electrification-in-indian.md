<p>The <a href="http://india.gov.in/" target="_blank">Government of India (GoI)</a> is currently targeting to have an estimated remaining 18000 new villages electrified by 2019. Whatâ€™s interesting, about this is that they have launched an app for the general public to track their progress:</p>

<p>Pretty cool indeed. As pointed out, iOS / Web users can track this <a href="http://kyrosoft.com/recpms/dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>. As any government should, MoS for Power, Coal, New &amp; Renewable energy Piyush Goyal is asking citizens to hold them accountable towards this promise, as we should. Considering additional statements made recently such as <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/i-have-given-states-an-offer-they-can-t-refuse-piyush-goyal-115111800047_1.html" target="_blank">UDAY discom debt scheme</a> and a projection of <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/india-wont-need-coal-imports-by-2017-piyush-goyal/articleshow/49801341.cms?utm_source=hootsuite" target="_blank">not importing thermal coal by 2017</a>, I think these are good signs for India in terms of power distribution. Watching closely.</p>
