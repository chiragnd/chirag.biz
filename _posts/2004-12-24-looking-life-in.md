<p><em>When the going gets tough, the tough get going.</em></p>
<p>This was the thought that hit him as he walked by, with the winds against him, fighting him, trying to make him stop, to go back, to command their direction onto him. Yet he stood firm. At first he did not move, then slowly he continued his journey, opposite to the forces pushing him. With time, the winds gave up.</p>
<p>He realized as he walked into the building…it’s never about reaching your goal, it’s about how you got there.</p>
