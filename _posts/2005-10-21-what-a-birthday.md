<p>I have some awwwweeesomely awesome residents!<br><br>First they come with cake and cards and balloons at midnight. Then they decorate my little passageway for me in the morning. And when the day was gloomy and the weather went bad…I read the card, and it was perfect! Literally, the best birthday card ever!!!<br><br>So then my staff wished me and made sure I remembered my birthday. <br><br>Then my cousin gave me her and my parents’ presents.<br><br>I got wished by my cousins and family and friends. I got tons and tons of facebook messages. Thanks everyone for those, I will reply to each of you within the next couple of days!<br><br>And then, we went on a C&amp;C generals rampage until 3 a.m! Totally this floor’s computer game of all time.<br><br> — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — –<br><br>If you ever had a birthday, and wanted it sooo badly again, for me it was when I turned 22.<br><br> — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -<br><br>I don’t normally give special shoutouts, because everyone just has an equal share. But from everyone I heard today, there was one name that really stood out.<br>I have to have a special secret shoutout to LND. LND is amazingly awesome, and put together a lot of the efforts. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH.</p>
