<blockquote>“I’d like nothing more than to apologize in person to everyone we’ve let down, but as you can see, many of our users are rarely home at this hour,” said Google cofounder and president Sergey Brin, pointing to several Google Map street-view shots of empty bedroom and living room windows on a projection screen behind him. “And, if last night’s searches are any indication, Boston’s Robert Hornick is probably out shopping right now for the spaghetti and clam sauce he’ll be cooking tonight.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Either that, or hunting down that blond coworker of his, Samantha, whose Picasa photos he stares at every night,” Brin added.</blockquote>
