Its ambience, fragrance and decor transported us away from the Dubai hustle and bustle to a place where fresh bread, delicious soups and pastries can be had multiple times a day without any effect to your waistline. The influence was completed by French music playing away above us, and an extremely smiling wait staff. I think I‚Äôd have melted if they spoke to me with a French accent, but alas, that wasn‚Äôt to happen.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/052e9-0a3uuuvvqks_77fkh.jpg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The menu is diverse, covering soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, pastries, you know the drill. I can confirm that the French Onion soup is the best I‚Äôve ever had, served in a lovely crusty bread and I absolutely need to go back for a sandwich that had some combination of organic bread, green apples and goat cheese.</p>\n<figure>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/5d7b3-0ggj1bfs-jujvia9n.jpg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>I was also pleasantly surprised by a mocktail‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpeach puree, pineapple and‚Ä¶spinach.

We concluded that the chef clearly knows his combinations. Worth a try.</p>\n<p>A visit to a patisserie cannot be complete without dessert. The chef‚Äôs recommended strawberry cheesecake was extremely fresh, and different compared to the usual American cheesecake varieties I‚Äôm used to.

			"content_text": "<figure>\n\n<img src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/662af8a6d9.jpg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Who wasn‚Äôt excited to hear about the Cheesecake Factory‚Äôs opening in the Dubai Mall in August? I was‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähaving loved their menu during my last visit to the US, not to mention all the Big Bang Theory love‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut when I learnt of the long wait times, decided I should let some time pass before trying it out.</p>\n<p>Not that it mattered. We ventured down to celebrate a birthday, and, lo and behold, the lines had not died down at all. ‚Äú1.5 hours‚Äù said the polite hostess as she handed us a little buzzer that would let us know when our table was ready. Yup, that‚Äôs how organized their wait cycle is.</p>\n<p>And how long their lines still are.</p>\n<p>(Btw, that‚Äôs the waiting line to get on the waiting list for a table.)</p>\n<p>We opened with the lettuce wraps, something I had tried and loved <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">during my US visit</a>, and was curious to see how that translated over.</p>\n<p>‚ÄòRather well‚Äô is the answer. The produce was fresh, the sauces delicious as always and the appetizer gained a thumbs up around the table.</p>\n<p>What is a bummer though: they‚Äôre not selling their dressings &amp; sauces like <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">they do in the US</a>. Bummer, bummer.</p>\n<p>I have to talk about the ‚Äòeggplant burger‚Äô‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs not exactly called that on the menu‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it is, by far, the best rendition of a grilled eggplant anything I‚Äôve had at a meal. Wrapped in a burger bun, topped with fresh melted cheese &amp; grilled onions and cooked to absolute perfection.</p>\n<p>The waiter might have been confused what the sandwich looked like (we were told it was a flatbread sandwich rather than a burger), but the chef most certainly was not. You may be a meat eater or an eggplant hater, but you‚Äôre going to have a hard time saying no to this. Ya hear me, Poston?</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever be able to classify the Factory into a specific cuisine, but at least they do them all well. With over 200 items on the menu, deciding what to eat was hard.</p>\n<p>We figured quesedillas were as different as the food was going to get, and these deserve a mention for being served with the freshest guacamole (yes, just about everything we had that afternoon had some avocado in it, but no regrets), delicious salsa and rich sour cream. The quesedillas were kept simple, just the way I like them.</p>\n<p>No celebration is complete without a slice of cheesecake‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwell, no visit to the Factory is complete without one either‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand, <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">just like in the US</a>, their staff obliged with a little deco to make the slice look as festive as possible.</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs interesting overall about my experience is the consistency. Even the look and feel of the decorated plate matched its US counterpart. Don‚Äôt believe me? <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/710976\" target=\"_blank\">Take a look for yourself</a>.</p>\n<p>The food was delicious, fresh and something you‚Äôd definitely want to go back for. The place is buzzing with activity, and if you can get around the incredible wait times‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto be fair, it can‚Äôt be that hard to kill time in the Dubai Mall right?‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou‚Äôre in for a treat.</p>\n<h4>The Cheesecake Factory</h4>\n<p>The Dubai Mall, opposite the Aquarium</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Originally published on Dec 10, 2012.</em></p>\n",

When my mom first saw that ID (I used to put it up as part of a wall collage of things I had done at my apartment in Philadelphia), her first reaction was ‚ÄòYou look exactly like Nanaji did when he was in college.‚Äô</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bc106-099hg4ve4ua79vkgo.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>I remember being supremely impressed by Nanaji when I stayed with my grandparents over the summer by myself in the 9th grade. As a routine, every morning at 7 a.m. you would see him fly out the door; he was a man who could not sit still. Laziness was so unknown to him that I am sure my lazy genes have all come from my paternal side. It was clockwork. Out the door at 7, back at 11.45 for lunch at noon sharp. Mind you, he needed his food piping hot, to the point where I had to sit for a bit before I could even consider eating. Back out again in the afternoon, back again for dinner punctually at 7, a habit you did not stop until last week. Nanima may have spoilt me with food and sweets throughout my stay, but Nanaji impressed me with pure action and few words.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple years, I was sad every time I visited you, watching you go from being house-ridden to bed-ridden, unable to move around on your own, your eyes still showing the fight and energy, but your body unable to keep up with the pace. You suffered for someone so active, so determined to be out of the house whenever you could. You made random, silly excuses to leave the house; you‚Äôd tell Nanima you needed to get the mail (downstairs) and disappear for a half hour because everyone told you you shouldn‚Äôt be out as much.</p>\n<p>You loved technology and new things. You were one of the few people who sat on a computer everyday, sending out emails and newsletters of things you read. You may not have been able to in the last couple of years, but I still remember and have the links you sent me to read.</p>\n<p>I remember last year when you were in a little better health, and I sat with you, you asked me what I did. The answer I gave you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas I give most people alien to IT‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädid not satisfy you and you asked for more. The curiosity didn‚Äôt leave your face until I explained in detail how we look after servers, how we deal with customers, what I did specifically in my role and how we handled issues if they arose with customers.</p>\n<p>You were the most active man I have ever met, in yours, my parents‚Äô and my own generation; an example of a human being.</p>\n<p>I miss you already. I‚Äôm glad you had your children and some of their children around you these last few weeks. And I am glad you are no longer in pain.</p>\n",

I don‚Äôt want to even begin to believe that a compact camera can do those shots.</em></p>\n<p><em>I won‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>When I first heard about Samsung‚Äôs new <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/topic/nx-system\" target=\"_blank\">NX series</a> line, I was a little intrigued. Samsung is not exactly known for its cameras, although that also means that I went in with no expectations.</p>\n<p>When I actually managed to take a few pictures with one, I was surprised. The Samsung NX1000 holds its own when it comes to photography as a compact camera for those wanting the options of inter-changable lenses while still carrying around a more portable device. And before you ask, yes, <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras/EV-NX1000BJPUS\" target=\"_blank\">it does come in pink</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, the camera is definitely recommended as a quality 20.3 megapixel camera that takes great shots whether in all-auto (SMART) or various less-auto/manual modes, at a competitive price in its range. The NX1000 does have features such as Wi-Fi, i-Fn and inbuilt filters that those cameras don‚Äôt; so it‚Äôs a good buy for the photo aficionado that wants something in that price range and quality.</p>\n<p>All other things being the same, I think its worth discussing the three elements that give the camera (well, the series, considering other cameras in the Samsung NX range have them as well) a little edge.</p>\n<h4>Wi-Fi</h4>\n<p>Samsung has incorporated Wi-Fi capabilities into the NX series. This allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload pictures to an offsite storage (currently integrated with SkyDrive)</li>\n<li>Upload pictures to social media (Facebook, Picasa)</li>\n<li>Extract pictures to your smartphone (iPhone, Android)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the share-the-second-I-take-a-picture generation, these are must-haves, although my own use of this during the review period wasn‚Äôt excessive. The Skydrive and social media integration are pretty self explanatory. The smartphone option is enabled with a Mobile-Link app for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilelink/id505414479?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsungimaging.filesharing&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> that allows you to connect to the camera as a hotspot, and offload pictures to the phone. This is actually quite nice, since you can edit them a bit if you like, and shuttle them off via social networks or email.</p>\n<p>Setup was rather easy so it wouldn‚Äôt be a pain for the non-network-savvy. Just a few clicks, and you‚Äôre on your way.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/d060b-0usi8grgc0wpp_wbx.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>Pulling photos onto a smartphone was a breeze</em></p>\n<h4>i-Fn</h4>\n<p>I used this feature the most out of the three. The Samsung smart lenses have an outer ring that allows you to activate menu controls to select options such as ISO and filters (see below) by rotating the ring rather than clicking the buttons. This made for a seamless experience during shooting without losing your grip, particularly if you want to take the setting to an extreme value.</p>\n<h4>Filters</h4>\n<p>In today‚Äôs Instagram age, filters are a smart add-on, no pun intended. The camera comes built in the a variety of smart filters such as vingetting, fish-eye, haftone dots, old film, etc. If I were to use filters, this‚Äôd be a better way I‚Äôd do it since you can actually position your shot to meet the filter rather than hope it works out in post-processing/uploading.</p>\n<p>Filter selection was easy enough and didn‚Äôt take more than a minute to master.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Vingetting Filter with Samsung NX1000\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/16c27-0fk9uxbjtt5it3jzb.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>Using inbuilt filters: Dragon Mart, Dubai with Vingetting</em></p>\n<p>Now onto the usual.</p>\n<h4>Build</h4>\n<p>I was happy with the build quality. While the body is plastic, it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap and is steady to use even when sitting in a moving vehicle (and no, I don‚Äôt mean while also driving!).</p>\n<p>Something was bothering me about the camera as I held it, but it took me more than a day to figure out what it was. I was about to take a macro shot of my favorite photography subject‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat‚Äôs right, food‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand as I brought the camera close to my face, I realized‚Ä¶ the NX1000 does not have a viewfinder at all. Your interface with the camera is entirely with 3.0\" LCD screen. This wasn‚Äôt tough to get used to but it took me by a little surprise as I‚Äôm someone that uses both for photography. That said, I‚Äôm sure the lack of a viewfinder helped with the form factor and I imagine most ready shooters will not mind.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs no built in flash, but an external flash is provided. I‚Äôm personally not a fan of using a flash in the day-to-day photography I do, so was happy with the decision since I‚Äôm sure it helped keep the weight that little bit down.</p>\n<h4>Low light</h4>\n<p>For a compact camera in its range, the NX1000 seems to handle low light shooting rather well. Both twilight shooting and indoor shooting were simple enough to do without too much modification; the auto-ISO settings seem to work well, and I was able to get a decent shot in with the ISO set at 12,800 (max setting). Granted, the picture was a little noisy but it did mean that a lower setting would have worked fine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/4cd3a-025x0gcaohfnl0djk.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>Low light indoor shooting looks good too. Hummus!</em></p>\n<h4>Overall</h4>\n<p>With the right amount of manual and effective auto controls, the NX1000 is a good camera for people of any expertise level, and the build is a plus because it‚Äôs definitely something you‚Äôll be happy carrying around. I think the NX1000 will compete directly with some entry level DSLRs on price‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsuch as the Canon 550‚Äì650D range‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand while they don‚Äôt exactly fall into the same class of cameras*, it‚Äôs a comparison that will happen considering the price point. The NX1000 carries the edge in portability and savvy features such as Wi-Fi and filters, while the DSLR would probably still be more appealing to the traditional photographer with more specific requirements.</p>\n<p>You can see more sample shots in the picture gallery below. As the opening quote suggests, the shots are pro-photographer (and big Canon-fan) approved!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true\" target=\"_blank\">https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true</a></p>\n<p>PS I‚Äôm currently looking at the other end of the same range, the NX20, so stayed tuned for a review soon!</p>\n<p>‚Äî -<br />*The NX1000 is a mirrorless camera. Mirrorless cameras tend to be more portable and compact compared to their DSLR counterparts, but suffer a bit in action-shot making. At the end of the day, these are two different systems although the price points are starting to line up. If you‚Äôre interested, <a href=\"http://www.mirrorless-dslr-guide.com/mirrorless-vs-normal-dslr.html\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a> has a good overview of the difference.</p>\n",

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm a big advocate of the web in terms of function, use and all that pretty stuff. But everything has its cons so let‚Äôs not be careless about it.</p>\n<p>To the experts, I say we really need to look at some standardization. The line‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<em>‚Ä¨‚Äô[t]he very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification‚Äô‚Ä™</em>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconcerns me deeply.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1eaaa-0jralijfl0bqf533x.jpg\" /></figure>\n<blockquote>Meet Mat Honan. He just had his digital life dissolved by hackers. <em>Photo: Ariel Zambelich/Wired. Illustration: Ross Patton/Wired</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In the space of one hour, my entire digital life was destroyed. First my Google account was taken over, then deleted. Next my Twitter account was compromised, and used as a platform to broadcast racist and homophobic messages. And worst of all, my AppleID account was broken into, and my hackers used it to remotely erase all of the data on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>‚Ä¶</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Apple‚Äôs and Amazon‚Äôs. Apple tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa partial credit card number‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat Apple used to release information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification. The disconnect exposes flaws in data management policies endemic to the entire technology industry, and points to a looming nightmare as we enter the era of cloud computing and connected devices.</blockquote>\n",

			"content_text": "<p><em>Note: I was given the Samsung Galaxy Nexus as a review unit.</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/3bedc-0t8enf36i0riujup7.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>‚ÄòYou are so not getting this phone back‚Äô.</p>\n<p>As far as first impressions go, I doubt it could get much better than that. More so since it comes from someone who doesn‚Äôt use a smartphone at all (no, don‚Äôt ask). Simply put, the Galaxy Nexus makes for a good looking phone. Like the impression someone at a party in a snazzy black outfit makes, before you speak to him/her, as the case applies. I don‚Äôt mean that the phone is bad when you do (or that the person‚Äôs a douche, yet), but you can‚Äôt know for sure until you have that conversation, can you?</p>\n<p>Since the Galaxy Nexus reached me a few days before the acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/\" target=\"_blank\">Jelly Bean</a> update, we‚Äôll hold off on the OS discussion until the update is done. At first glance however, the phone looks pretty stable. I‚Äôm not a fan of the back though‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe approach seems a bit flimsy, and reminded me of those <a href=\"http://www.meccano.com/models/starter-bulldozer.html/\" target=\"_blank\">sets I played with as a kid</a>. Unless that was the idea, in which case they did a great job.</p>\n<p>The size of the Galaxy Nexus also takes a bit of getting used to, being larger in comparison to other phones, so this doesn‚Äôt seem like a device you can use comfortably with one hand for extended periods of time. But that‚Äôs not a real deal-breaker. On the flip side, this display is quite good and the extra screen space makes for better reading.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/70123-0kjxjbfi0dtx0ibtb.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>A nice display and a good churning droid.</em></p>\n<p>The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to, and so far, typing with one hand requires active use of the auto-suggestions to be quick. The other thing that really got to me though was the position of the sleep and volume buttons that are on the phone‚Äôs side (say, in comparison to the top of the iPhone for sleep/wake). This meant I often hit the sleep button accidentally while using the phone, which can take some getting used to. Maybe I‚Äôm just holding it wrong.</p>\n<p>If, like me, you live your life in Google‚Äôs castle from time to time, initial set up is snappy and the single sign-on with your (multiple like most of us‚Ä¶just me, you say? Okay.) Google account is intuitive. Email, contacts, calendar and browser preferences are sync‚Äôd without much fuss, the last once you download Chrome on <a href=\"http://www.android.com/about/ice-cream-sandwich/\" target=\"_blank\">Ice Cream Sandwich</a> (I‚Äôm unclear of the logic behind Chrome not being default until Jelly Bean, but my theory is <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/google-io-2012\" target=\"_blank\">Google just doesn‚Äôt think like that</a>).</p>\n<p>The Android market‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänow the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Store</a>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis thriving in its own steam, so apps for most needs are easy to find. The experience over the first day has been positive overall, and the phone does justify its generally good feedback.</p>\n<p>Stand by, a full review with notes on Jelly Bean will be here soon!</p>\n",

			"content_text": "<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02506\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/74de27b5ac.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>I‚Äôve continued to stay heartbroken since <a href=\"https://naihar.com/pizza-pizza-a58e8e51702e#.eb7cevh1t\" target=\"_blank\">my favorite pizza place in Dubai</a> shut down almost two years ago, back when my photo skills were absolute bullshevic (thanks, Madagascar 3!). The photos are only marginally better now, granted, but I shudder at <a href=\"https://naihar.com/mango-and-curried-chickpea-salad-9ce4d2c02c36\" target=\"_blank\">those woeful pictures</a>, ew.</p>\n<p>As I was about to say, throw me a lightly charred pie from a wood-fired brick oven, that cooks in 3 minutes and I‚Äôll be your fan for life. It‚Äôs what defines a real pizza for me. I‚Äôll typically take a look at a picture (or the real thing) and almost instinctively decide whether I‚Äôll like the pizza or not. I had searched frantically for a shot when Jamie‚Äôs Italian introduced pizzas at their Dubai outlet a few months ago before I agreed to try them out. Speaking of which, I need to blog about that experience soon eventually.</p>\n<p>So it was little surprise that <a href=\"http://foodiva.net/2012/05/a-slice-of-napoli-pizza-in-dubai/\" target=\"_blank\">Foodiva‚Äôs post about Rossovivo</a> caught my eye. The review was definitely positive and the pictures got me excited. Could it be, could it? Alas, I had to hold my hopes when the dinner being organized there a few weeks ago was moved after the guest list expanded to a size beyond Rossovivo‚Äôs current capacity.</p>\n<p>But let it be known that I pestered incessantly waited patiently until another visit was scheduled last weekend. And while I want to let the pictures speak for themselves, we all know that‚Äôs not really going to happen.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02504\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/335bde7ac6.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02507\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/b3f9f43ef9.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02502\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/6551ef2599.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>Pic 1</em>: The Bufalina. A thing of beautiy. <em>I wish I‚Äôd realized that the menu was not out of the shot enough, but this is where you thank me for revealing 87.5% of the delivery number before the end.<br />Pic 2: </em>The Raffaele. Who knew pistachio on a pizza could work?<br /><em>Pic 3: The Marinara</em></p>\n<p>The star of the show‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor me, anyway‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas the Bufalina: Buffalo cheese, tomato, basil. You could taste the difference in the quality of the cheese instantly and, coupled with the crust, it made for the perfect minimalist pizza I enjoy. I jumped at the tomato and garlic Marinara‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämy mind forgetting that it also meant there was no cheese on it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut the sauce was the right amount of fresh and tangy that I ate it all up anyway.</p>\n<p>The surprise of the show‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas the Raffaele: pizza with, wait for it, pistachio! Named after the Chef himself. Frankly I thought it was outright bizarre but I did try a little piece‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe all live for bizarre, don‚Äôt we?‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I‚Äôll admit the chef gets points for creativity. Pistachio and cheese do seem to go together despite my initial objections, and the women at the table absolutely loved it.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02497\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/0793663645.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02498\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/0f637a83d2.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc02509\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/119e49053e.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Love the fact that you can watch your pizzas being made at the table.</p>\n<p>So finally, a pizza place I can rave about again. It helped that someone used me as a landmark with a taxi-driver to spot the place while I stood outside frantically calling everyone waiting quietly for everyone to arrive; nothing like an ego boost just before you‚Äôre treated to amazing buffalo cheese pizza.</p>\n<p><strong>Rossovivo</strong></p>\n<p>Millenium Tower, Business Bay, just off the service road.<br /><a href=\"http://www.rossovivo.ae/\" target=\"_blank\">www.rossovivo.ae</a> | +9714 380 5833</p>\n",

			"title": "Review: Samsung Slate PC Series 7",
			
			"content_text": "<p><em>My initial thoughts with the </em><a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/tablet-pcs/XE700T1A-A01US\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Samsung Slate PC Series 7</em></a><em> are available </em><a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>What a difference a couple of weeks can make I suppose. As promised during my <a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7\" target=\"_blank\">initial thoughts</a>, I pushed myself to break routine and use the SlatePC as my primary device over two weeks. Despite the fact that I‚Äôm not a traditional Windows fan as such (without getting into it here, the OS just bothers me over time, as any regular Linux or OS X user will tell you), the SlatePC is a good bet, particularly as a work device, with some caveats.</p>\n<p>To start with, it‚Äôs the software/OS and not really Samsung that‚Äôs the issue here, as I‚Äôve already raised. Windows 7 just does not allow you to really enjoy the SlatePC‚Äôs potential. With it, I ran the device almost entirely as a desktop computer, plugged into the dock with an external keyboard/mouse. I was unable to really use the touchscreen‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeither because my fat fingers couldn‚Äôt hit the x in one try ever, or because I kept playing whack-a-mole with the on-screen keyboard. The SlatePC though does come with standard specs you see in today‚Äôs laptops, so it did function well in this combination.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/49ee8-0epamj4tpoqdm17sg.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>But that changed when I moved to Windows 8. For those who are ambitious, Samsung has officially <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/global/windowspreview/\" target=\"_blank\">put up a page dealing with this migration</a> (which I think is smart in and of itself) with drivers for the SlatePC. I did face an issue with the touchscreen not being responsive, but the should-be-patented-process of uninstall driver, resintall driver sorted that out. And the device came alive once the metro layout was in place. Granted, this isn‚Äôt a Windows 8 review‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is probably a good idea to put through at some point.</p>\n<p>Win8 also made the hardware seem better than Win7 did. For example, battery life jumped for a barebones 2.5 hours to almost 4‚Äì5 hours of use under Win8, which made portability that much better. I‚Äôm sure Samsung is already looking at putting together some apps to the Windows 8 Store, which might make development easier compared to builing their own custom ‚Äòhome screen‚Äô they have on the Slate for Win7.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/92d7f-0clgtsjwrdfi64k-b.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>Much better touch experience with Win8.</em></p>\n<p>So the net verdict: If you‚Äôre a Windows user and need a change or are trying of lunging around a 5-kg laptop around with you, with Win8 you should seriously consider this form factor. I‚Äôm sure the release of the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/\" target=\"_blank\">Surface</a> by Microsoft is going to add to the disruption, but I find it interesting that Samsung has already put together a device in this form factor that is a great fit for organizations, particularly with travelling employees.</p>\n<p>I realize I‚Äôve said that (professional/work device) a few times, but that‚Äôs because at AED4,500, I feel the price point is a bit steep to become an mass regular Joe device. But this price is actually comparable to current business grade laptops that fall in the same range with the same specs. Let‚Äôs not forget how much my shoulder thanked me as I carried just this to and from meetings. (With a shoutout to <a href=\"http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2591582&amp;topic=1693469&amp;ctx=topic\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome sync</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dropbox</a> for making my to-and-fro use of two full fledged devices really easy).</p>\n<p>In the real world though, my co-workers and customers eyed the device intriguingly. One of my customers felt it was a great idea to adopt the SlatePC considering they spend the same on bulkier 14\" laptops that every travelling user they have complains about. And I‚Äôll concede that note taking directly to soft copy made me immensely happy. As did interviewing and marking off CVs directly on screen. No, no screenshots of that are available, sorry.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/10028-0lgomjersgg7iazof.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>So I‚Äôm geeky. Like you didn‚Äôt know.</em></p>\n<p>There you have it. A good piece of hardware, a pretty looking device too and a tricky OS. Win7 might not let you get everything out of the device, but with Win8, there is tremendous potential. I don‚Äôt think Samsung really intends this to be a professional device though (purely based on current marketing and the way it‚Äôs listed under ‚ÄòHome‚Äô on their site), but I do believe that‚Äôs where it holds its true potential.</p>\n",

			"title": "First Impressions: Samsung Slate PC, Series 7",
			
			"content_text": "<p><em>Note: I was given a Samsung Slate PC Series 7 review unit this week to play with. Okay, maybe those weren‚Äôt their exact words, but how else would I describe it?<br /><br />Note 2: I intend to write this as a series of two posts‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFirst Impressions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcovering Day 1 with the Slate and an overall review.</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/6a063-0ifkbzsjfn1jcqc3b.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>I‚Äôm a little confused, actually. I‚Äôm not entirely sure where Samsung intended to place the Slate PC Series 7 in a consumer‚Äôs lifecycle and I think if they figure that bit out, they‚Äôll have done well.</p>\n<p>To clarify, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad device at all, but I‚Äôm unsure how this fits into my laptop+smartphone life. However, it is already clear to me that a comparison of the SlatePC with something like the iPad is not possible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe two do not deal with the same market or have the same goal at all. So I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep the iPad away from this discussion. The SlatePC is a PC replacement for someone who wants to be fairly mobile, where you want the full functionality of a PC operating system but the mobility of something like the iPad. So I think this is something that would compete with the Macbook Air for market share.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ea457-0qrmgsxhohrdephe9.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Staying on point, I can see how the SlatePC would be a good alternative to the PC for someone like me, who moves around, works with wifi where I can, considering it runs a full version of Windows (Win7). At the same time, this is where the problem is. For a devicefocused on having a touch screen, Win7 is extremely cumbersome to use with touch. Thankfully, the device does come with a compact docking station and external bluetooth keyboard (I‚Äôll say it again, thank goodness, the on-screen keyboard in Win7 is pure torture to use with my fat fingers, and using it with the Slate pen feels like a game of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole\" target=\"_blank\">whack-a-mole</a>). But this is a software problem.</p>\n<p>Going back to the hardware, the packing is simple and clean. I wish they‚Äôd put in a little crevice to unattach the device though‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI ended up having to flip the whole thing over to get the Slate PC out. All in all, not a bad looking device on your table by any means.</p>\n<p>But with Win7, the device acts more like a regular PC than a portable device, forcing you to carry around the keyboard/mouse and dock for usability. What‚Äôs more, without any data capabilities, you‚Äôre reliant on a wifi connection or one of those USB 3G modems, so I didn‚Äôt really benefit from having it with me while I was stuck waiting on my EmiratesID appointment.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/a08c3-0qng3dbelzcx5hx4j.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>So my first impression is that this is a good device from a hardware standpoint. Powerful, pretty robust, a little awkward sizing compared to other devices in this form factor‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut not something that you cannot get used to. However, the software aspect is a major problem with Win7 not being ideal for touch/on the go.</p>\n<p>That said, there is potential if packaged with Win8, where you‚Äôd have both aspects‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätouch and regular PC use‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcovered and the Slate PC has the hardware to run this‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomething I hope to test over the next couple weeks, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p><em>Update: Part 2 of this review is available </em><a href=\"http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35211654061/review-samsung-slate-pc-series-7\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n",

The foodie in me plays a big role in deciding where to go on a holiday. And yes I do travel with a list of restaurants ready!</p>\n<p>On a recent trip to India‚Äôs capital Delhi, I was of course blown away by the amount of good food available. So much so that I did manage to put on a few kilos, but it was much to my delight!</p>\n<p>Pictured here is the ultimate chicken tikka from a traditional Indian roadside eatery- Rajinder da dhaba. The thing about these quintessential dhabas are although you might not like to sit there and eat, you cannot resist the amazing aromas each one carries. Rajinder Singh is known among the Green Park area residents for this scrumptious, succulent and perfectly spiced chicken tikka. Served in a little bowl made of dried leaves, with cool mint and yoghurt chutney on the side, his chicken morsels will melt in your mouth leaving behind an irresistible aftertaste of tandoori spices. Like so many other traditional eateries, this one started out as the eatery for taxi drivers, truckers and assorted transport people. Now though, you can sit in his air conditioned hall and enjoy.</p>\n<p>Oh and I only managed one shot because I couldn‚Äôt wait to tuck in!</p>\n",

You can read her post <a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/falafel-manakish/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: Having known <a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com\" target=\"_blank\">Arva</a> couple years now, our manakish discussions have always been interesting. So when I mentioned the falafel manakish a while ago, it just had to be tested. Who cares if it took 8 months to actually make the trip happen. I‚Äôm excited then, to bring you a joint foodie post‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe first of its kind. Think of it like a special episode.</p>\n<p>Note 2: The word man‚Äôousheh in our post is not some kind of auto-correct defect. It‚Äôs the singular of manakish in Arabic. Yes it is. No, it‚Äôs not right to say can I have a manakish with cheese. Yes, we know you‚Äôve said it before, we have too. No, it‚Äôs never too late to change.</p>\n<p><em>Chirag had told me about these falafel manakish in Karama. That‚Äôs like waving a bone in front of a dog, go fetch. I barked till he agreed to take me there.</em></p>\n<p><em>I came across the falafel man‚Äôousheh quite by accident‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcome to think of it, this is starting to ring true for a lot of really good food I find. The term they first used at </em><strong><em>Moulin D‚ÄôOr</em></strong><em> when I walked in a few years ago during late night certification classes was: falafel sandwiches. But sandwich it was not. I watched their chef make what looked like a green topping man‚Äôousheh wondering what he was up to, before I realized they really meant ‚Äòfalafel man‚Äôousheh.‚Äô I‚Äôd had falafel manousheh just once before in Abu Dhabi, where the guy tried to break open what I believe was a solitary falafel over labneh in a combination that, well, was clearly not worth blogging about.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Moulin D‚ÄôOr</strong> however, put a nice spin on a traditional offering, spreading delicious falafel batter on a manousheh dough, topped with tahini, tomatoes, some greens and pickles. I can get aboard that train any day.</p>\n<p><em>Me too‚Ä¶any day, ALL day. And if I‚Äôm hopping on any train, I‚Äôm taking both Chirag and </em><a href=\"http://www.sheban.net/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sheban</em></a><em>‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätwo outrageously smart, tech-wired entrepreneurs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith me, and making a food tour working session of it. Yeah I know, *everything* these days is about the food tours. I‚Äôll launch it and then I‚Äôll shut up already. Or maybe you‚Äôll see promo SMS spam on food tours violently possess your cellphones. You can turn off the TV, turn off the radio, shut your eyes tight when you pass an annoying yellow bakeshop-plastered billboard, but cellphone‚Ä¶that‚Äôs where I‚Äôve got you *right* where I want you, because Dubai has established that your cellphone is the one place you can never opt out of promo spam. It‚Äôs the Hotel California of ominous marketing spam, you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave‚Ä¶</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3186-fatayer\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/3591b3991c.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>But I will admit, when I stepped into Moulin D‚ÄôOr, the food tours were the last thing on my mind. For someone whose Achilles heel lies in warm buttery baked goodies, this was heavenly hell. I walked in and it all just smacked me in the face: giant croissants puffed up like angry birds, small white discs of pastry smattered with za‚Äôatar and cheese, chocolate glazed rows of ganache and coffee buttercream-layered Opera cake, boats and crescents and all the usual shapes of tiny fatayer with cheese and meat and veggies. How had I not ever given Moulin D‚ÄôOr a second glance on my visits across the street to Al Reef Bakery? Imagine, all those mornings where I could have been living the dream with HULK buttery croissants‚Ä¶</em></p>\n<p>Seriously? You know you can get giant croissants anywhere right? It‚Äôs the falafel man‚Äôousheh that‚Äôs a rare species around here. And to think we almost missed it that evening. When I walked up to <strong>Moulin D‚ÄôOr</strong>‚Äôs manakish oven, my heart skipped a beat. I didn‚Äôt see the A4 printed sign in Calibri that used to read ‚ÄúFalafel Sandwich, 5 Dhs‚Äù. It would seem we were a couple months too late to make the trip, and the falafel man‚Äôousheh had now morphed into a mainstream falafel sandwich, no frills. Dejected, we walked back to the table. I was devastated, Sheban looked sad but could potentially be won over with a meaty fatayer, but Arva? Arva hadn‚Äôt really accepted the tragic news at all. She just strolled right back to the counter, because one more attempt at sighting the falafel manousheh was *absolutely* necessary. Skipping over a comment relating to women, better service and the GCC, I will merely point out that the chef agreed to make a couple of manakish just for us.</p>\n<p><em>I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I do use my chubby womanly charm when it comes to food. That‚Äôs not a bad thing now, is it?</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3169-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/ee3456b8a2.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Considering how the evening had progressed, the manakish‚Äôs arrival to the table was that much more exciting. The consensus around the table was that it looked even better than expected <em>(though I was just gobsmacked with hunger by this point to have any expectations at all).</em> I was just glad our trip had not been in vain. Crisp manousheh dough, layered with awesome falafel mix, topped with tahina and <strong>crunch‚Ä¶</strong>a quiet calm engulfed the table as we ate <em>(save for my incessant questions about food tours this and food tours that)</em>. Falafel makes for a very light man‚Äôousheh when not fried, and although I felt that my memory of the manousheh I‚Äôd had here years ago was slightly better than the reality on my plate, this was still‚Ä¶</p>\n<p><em>‚Ä¶satisfying. Of all the man‚Äôousheh I‚Äôve tried, the salty-bitter za‚Äôatar and </em><a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/danat-al-khaleej-lebanese-fattayer/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>cheese ones</em></a><em>, the </em><a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/breakfast-to-breakfast-manakish-dubai/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>meaty sujuk ones</em></a><em>, the </em><a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/mount-lebabnon-lebneh-jam-manakish/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>creamy sweet lebneh ones</em></a><em>, I‚Äôd say this falafel man‚Äôousheh was the more subtle of the lot. The man‚Äôousheh innards were so light that if you guzzled it down thoughtlessly, you wouldn‚Äôt hear the falafel spread murmur fragrantly from the crust. The base was thin and crispy, disintegrating into a crunch reminiscent of a stroll over dry autumn leaves in a city with four seasons. There was no cheese, and if there was tahina, it was barely there. The whole ensemble was delicate and understated.</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3184-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/e11d2a6f79.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3174-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/1e66f7043f.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cd3178-falafel-manakish\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/4856058702.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>The manakish must have been good, because we talked about falafels for about 20 minutes afterwards. Did you guys know there‚Äôs a falafel bar in Sharjah? <em>NaaahsssSSSH! It‚Äôs a secret!¬†</em>‚Ä¶but more on that later. I can‚Äôt guarantee that <strong>Moulin D‚ÄôOr</strong> will entertain more requests for the coveted man‚Äôousheh, but having a woman in your party apparently helps. If not, they do have a decent repertoire of manakish to choose from.<em></em></p>\n<p><em>And cheesy fatayer and angry bird croissants. Yumsies.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Moulin D‚ÄôOr</strong></p>\n<p>Drive past Karama Post Office and you‚Äôll see it on your right (before Options Furniture Building).¬†<br /><a href=\"http://www.moulin-dor.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.moulin-dor.com</a> | +9714 3547847</p>\n<p>You can find the cross-posted version on Arva‚Äôs blog <a href=\"http://www.iliveinafryingpan.com/falafel-manakish/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n",

			"content_text": "<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09398\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/5196a31f09.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>For me, mexican food comes with a truckload of childhood memories (ok, some adult ones too) associated with it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom the weird experimentations that eventually lead to a decent <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/black-bean-burritos\" target=\"_blank\">home-made burrito</a> to trying a variety of taco and quesedilla makers in the market (none of them worked, incidentally), to eating them in all forms‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe traditional <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/pastel-de-tres-leches\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Bonita style</a>, the fast food Taco Bell style (okay, not anymore) and a few <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/9-great-iphotos-9\" target=\"_blank\">others in between</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09388\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/a431ff04f5.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>So when I was asked to check out Amerigos, I was excited‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut I also didn‚Äôt look them up beforehand so I didn‚Äôt fully know what to expect. My <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/pizza-mamma-rossella\" target=\"_blank\">previous experience</a> in the Yas Marina Circuit was actually rather good; but taking your parents along when reviewing food can always be tricky, what with specific food preferences and them having to wait while I snap up pictures of life, the universe and everything.</p>\n<p>Now for those of you who want the answer quickly, Amerigos passed!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09455\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/c4f2794257.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09461\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/9e8690b6ed.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09453\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/2543b5ceb0.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09377\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/2153b98c92.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>To begin with, I was happily surprised by the atmosphere and setup. While it is part of the Park Inn by Radisson, Amerigos has a very casual and comfortable decor, a semi-outdoor setting, an indoor sports bar *and* a pool area. With the weather still holding up, the experience was enjoyable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is a place that works for friends, family, a nice quiet evening or an after-work hours meet and greet.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09401\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/d6470791d2.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09404\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/4209e1159d.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09389\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/e6b753b5d2.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09399\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/09d099ff2f.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09395\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/57f5c24820.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Food wise, the menu has quite a bit to offer. The menu is modelled more on what I would call Tex-Mex rather than pure Mexican. The guacamole was wonderful and among the freshest I‚Äôve had. The other surprise item‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwell, surprise because we added it on as an afterthough halfway through the maincourse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwere the Fajitas.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09428\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/7375dcffc6.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09426\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/4928691374.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Trust me, their ‚Äòstir-fry‚Äô, for want of a better word was so good, I just kept eating the mix without having the patience to actually roll up the fajitas.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09419\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/cf7e5c1499.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09418\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/03470104a8.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Overall, the food was on well done &amp; fresh. The chef seems to like keeping things simple‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomething that works very well for Amerigos.</p>\n<p>We were a bit intrigued by something called <em>Hojaldre de Vegetales</em> which was a puff pastry filled with vegetables and an escabeche sauce. While there was nothing really wrong with it at all, it just didn‚Äôt feel very Mexican compared to everything else we had and enjoyed.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09413\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/8061d5ae3e.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Since I‚Äôm sure those of you who got this far will want to know, I‚Äôm doing the smart thing and attachingthe dessert menu for your comfort. I went for the lime, mint &amp; rum sorbet since I was looking for something light‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand in hindsight, perhaps the rice pudding might have been more traditional option.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09434\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/99f2a927a8.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09436\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/267566fd79.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09450\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/f57ff7b544.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>In the end, it boiled down to the usual two suspects‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe food and the atmophere, and Amerigos does really well on both counts. There was a healthy crowd through the evening‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpeople out with family and friends, and football fans enjoying the large screens at the bar. Amerigos makes a great choice if you‚Äôre up for a leisurely drive across the Circuit followed by a satisfying meal or if you happen to be in the area.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc09465\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/029fe83c14.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Amerigos Mexican Restaurant &amp; Bar</strong></p>\n<p>Park Inn by Radisson, Yas Island, Abu Dhabi<br />(Just drive down the Yas Island Leisure Drive until you hit the hotel area, Park Inn is the first one on your left)<br />+9712 656 2222</p>\n",

Now that I think about it, I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt more often considering my (borderline crazy) fascination with taking multiple shots of food at restaurants and eateries.</p>\n<p>Right, let‚Äôs get the disclaimer out first: I love hummus. Part of my life‚Äôs mission involves hunting for decent hummus*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand don‚Äôt scoff, enough outlets get it wrong for me to include it in a mission statement. That‚Äôs how much I adore this awesome chickpea creation. So when I spotted a little outlet in Barsha named after it, I was intrigued enough.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08836\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/708d927b43.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>Foul W Hummus</em> is a fantastic testament to the ‚Äòless is more‚Äô philosophy. With a simple menu comprising three main items‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFoul, Hummus &amp; Falafel (and related variations) only, they may only do a few things, but they do them right.</p>\n<p>This is particularly true when it comes to their hummus; the only word that comes to mind is <em>addictive</em>! They seem to have their proportions perfectly right‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust enough creaminess and just enough tahini‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto always leave us licking the edges of the containers every time we go. They also keep a constantly-on-the-stove container of boiled whole chickpeas to add that perfect warmth into each serving.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08794\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/f873191a9c.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08795\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/01b28970b2.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>I‚Äôm a regular, as Mahmoud (who mans the entrance and phones) will assure you. Heck, I‚Äôve even got cousins all the way in South America craving their hummus months after their last visit (during which, mind, we made 4 trips to the place in a week). We‚Äôre not the only ones either; stop by on a Friday morning and you‚Äôll barely be able to stand in there‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich will only make you glad they get their orders done quickly!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08801\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/087af8873e.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08800\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/5aa06d480e.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc08809\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/be368d59af.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p><em>Foul W Hummus</em> does have other items on their menu‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfoul and falafels‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääboth of which are good as well. I will admit I‚Äôve had better falafels and foul elsewhere, but theirs is still among the fresher ones available around town. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶their hummus is so enjoyable, the others pale a little in comparison. We‚Äôve also tried their fatteh‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is yummy as well except it dries up quickly, so I don‚Äôt recommend getting it unless you‚Äôre eating it there, or in the car on your way home.

On my recent trip to Sri Lanka,a certain devilled dish sent my palate up in roars and of course I needed rescuing and well water, juice, bread etc. don‚Äôt help at all‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat least in my case. So the waiting staff brought me a simply but beautifully plated dish of ‚Äòspiced coconut custard‚Äô or <strong>Watalappan</strong>.</p>\n<p>At first sight, it was a light, spongy textured piece of cake with a caramelized top, garnished with strawberries. On taking a spoonful, the Watalappan just melted in my mouth. Smooth, airy and creamy egg custard, with a rich coconut flavor, doused in nutmeg, cardamom and cinnamon and baked to perfection. The beautiful golden color is mainly attributed to Jaggery, which is used to sweeten, also gives the custard a distinct color and flavor.</p>\n<p>I spent the rest of my holiday, trying out Watalappan in different cities in Sri Lanka and I must say that <a href=\"http://www.randholeeresorts.com/content.php?sub=3\" target=\"_blank\">Randholee Resort</a> in Kandy, takes the cherry.</p>\n",

This time I decided I would attempt to make a favourite of mine. Ferrero Rocher Cheesecake. This took some imagination and a little bit of research. I finally decided to alter a few recipes which I found to make my own.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates</li>\n<li>One jar of Nutella</li>\n<li>1 250g packet of Chocolate Digestive Biscuits</li>\n<li>100g Butter, melted</li>\n<li>1 Tub of Double Cream (300ml)</li>\n<li>1 Tub of Cream Cheese (300g Philadelphia)</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons of Icing Sugar</li>\n<li>a handful of chopped roasted Hazelnuts (to decorate)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Line the cheesecake tin with baking parchment</li>\n<li>Crush the digestive biscuits in a mixer and add the melted butter into the mixer. Pulse the mixture till combined.</li>\n<li>Pour into the cheesecake tin and press down firmly</li>\n<li>Whip a bit of the cream with the Philadelphia to soften and remove any lumps.</li>\n<li>Whip the rest of the cream in a separate bowl with the icing sugar</li>\n<li>Add the softened Philadelphia to whipped cream and mix till just combined</li>\n<li>Pour the combined cream cheese mixture into the cheesecake tin, smoothing down with a spatula or spoon.</li>\n<li>Spread a layer of Nutella over the cream cheese mixture.</li>\n<li>Sprinkle on some roasted chopped hazelnuts</li>\n<li>Add one whole Ferrero Rocher per slice of cheesecake. (usually 8/10 slices)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Top tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are making it in a cheesecake tin, line the tin with baking parchment</li>\n<li>Grease the baking parchment with some butter to make it stick to the inside of the tin</li>\n<li>You can make individual cheesecake pots (see picture above)</li>\n<li>Press the digestive biscuit base down gently with a spoon or fingers if you like getting messy</li>\n<li>Dipping the spoon/spatula in water helps the Nutella layer smooth out</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I love making cheesecakes almost as much as I love devouring them. I dare you to give this one a try, you will not be disappointed. Happy Cheesecake making!</p>\n",

According to the food historians, the ancient Egyptians were the first culture to show evidence of advanced baking skills. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the English word ‚Äòcake‚Äô back to the 13th century. According to food historians, the precursors of modern cakes (round ones with icing) were first baked in Europe sometime in the mid-17th century. It was not until the middle of the 19th century that cake as we know it today arrived on the scene and the birthday cake became an integral part of the birthday celebrations in Western cultures since the middle of the 19th century.

			"content_text": "<p>I am a man of simple pleasures. And for those who know me, Iced Tea is my simplest pleasure. Which reminds me, I need to go place my iced tea bottle into the freezer for a quick chill.</p>\n<p>Where was I again? Right, so this afternoon we strolled down to one of my favorite dessert shops, Brunetti. Jumping straight for the usual suspects, their little tiramisu container and some cappuccino, we wandered around to see what else attracted our eye. Their cheesecake looked alright, but sitting smugly next to it was a pear and cheese crumble that we proceeded to‚Ä¶crumble. Good stuff.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00042\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/3a42fe5589.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00044\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/5a89b332d7.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>We also came across a Bacio. This was pretty much a chocolate mousse with some hazelnut but it looked oh so pretty with the little layer of chocolate around it.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00039\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/cbb54dc088.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00041\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/12cf675070.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>As we started ordering drinks‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe went with a cappuccino, espresso and an orange juice, I started fumbling, unable to decide as my impatient company towered over me telling me to hurry up, unable to understand why I needed more time than I was given while they decided. I tried to read a very italian name (which I will need to go back to Brunetti to get exactly and then update here Te freddo al limone) and was like man, I can‚Äôt imagine what that would be‚Ä¶until in little tiny characters I read the words that always get me going: homemade iced-tea with lemon. Voila!</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve got to set up a disclaimer here. When in the US, reading those words were like gold. It meant I was in for a treat. Out here sadly, the words iced tea tend to be abused pretty easily. So despite reading those words, and my general affinity for Brunetti, I expect little until this mammoth glass was deposited on the table.</p>\n<p>The hell was this‚Ä¶?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00047\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/d397f4f2d0.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Yup, iced tea with a comfortable, convenient and yummy deposit of ice cream. Goodness me‚Ä¶.goodness me.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00049\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/0f88b14d8b.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00050\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/28f3c1304f.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>I‚Äôve never seen it before (and that‚Äôs saying considering it‚Äôs a given that if there‚Äôs iced tea on the menu that‚Äôs not out of a can, I‚Äôve ordered it), and I was amazed. We quite literally just stared at the thing for a while.</p>\n<p>But this takes the cake, pun not intended. I seem to have found <em>the </em>iced tea. And interestingly, it has nothing to do with the ice cream at all. The tea itself was light, fresh as it could possibly be, with the right amount of mint without being overwhelming. (I realize everyone now thinks I‚Äôve got to be insane to psycho-analyze iced tea, but hey‚Ä¶I yam, what I am.)</p>\n<p>The ice cream itself was good, not too sweet, and somehow didn‚Äôt overly melt and ruin anything. Over time, it lightly drizzled itself into the tea without overwhelming it at all and considering most people have their tea with milk anyway, the taste was more than acceptable.</p>\n<p>The iced tea itself runs you to AED24, which is slightly higher than what is normally out there (AED12‚Äì20) but it still on par with the general Brunetti value.</p>\n<p>Goodness that was good iced tea.</p>\n<p>Goodness, goodness me.</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Brunetti</strong>, +9714 339 8173<br /><a href=\"http://www.brunetti.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.brunetti.com.au/</a></p>\n<p>The Dubai Mall (Next to <a href=\"http://blog.naihar.com/a-trip-to-candyland\" target=\"_blank\">Candylicious</a>, opp. the Dubai Aquarium)</p>\n",

Boasting authentic food, the real reason I wanted to try it out was because someone who tried out my <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13\" target=\"_blank\">favorite pizzeria in Dubai</a> (which has since shut down) said he had liked Il Forno better.</p>\n<p>Not one to take criticism poorly, I tried it.</p>\n<p>One bite in and Il Forno fell into the category of just another pizza place. They‚Äôre not bad, but they‚Äôre not great either. I only tried their pizza‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI went with their garlic-and-olive-oil option‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand felt mostly like I was eating a couple-hours-old manakish. The crust was overwhelming, didn‚Äôt feel too fresh and the cheese was your usual unfrozen mozzarella. The iced tea I had with the pizza was your standard run-of-the-mill restaurant iced tea and not brewed or such either.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc03681_1\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/b76eb96cb4.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Il Forno works with something that does look like a woodfire oven, although it‚Äôs a pretty standard one in reality. The staff were friendly though and while I‚Äôve only tried their pizzas on a couple different occasions, it‚Äôs been with the same results.</p>\n<p>For those following closely, the search continues for good pizza in the UAE. There are some <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/pizza-mamma-rossella\" target=\"_blank\">I like</a>, some I don‚Äôt and others I despise (and therefore, haven‚Äôt really visited since the start of this blog). But I‚Äôve received some <a href=\"http://foodiva.net/2011/07/dubais-best-pizza-emporio-armani-caffe/\" target=\"_blank\">good suggestions</a> and will post up once I get a chance to try them out.

Come to think of it, I can‚Äôt think of anyone who‚Äôs ever told me they hate Gummies. Maybe not biggest fans, but don‚Äôt like Gummies. Yea, NEVER happens. Gummies are things that you can‚Äôt stop eating once you start, then you feel sick and tell yourself, okay not having *that* many again. Until a couple of days later, you walk by a store that sells gummies and‚Ä¶pfft, what‚Äôs another entire pack going to do‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI survived fine last time!</p>\n<p>I indulged heavily in gummies‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägummy bears &amp; worms in particular during my stay in Philadelphia. With everything from the next block grocery store to the elaborate candy stores carry them, they were never in short supply. Over time, you even new which ones carried fresh gummies (yes, there is such a thing as ‚Äòfresh‚Äô gummies compared to stale ones. It matters!).</p>\n<p>Moving back to Dubai meant a literal cut down in the amount of gummy intake. That probably wasn‚Äôt a bad thing but you also don‚Äôt find gummies around the block, and when you do, they just seem expensive. Ofcourse, all has changed over time and I can safely say I can find gummies within a 10 minute radius from whereever I am these days.</p>\n<p>This however, brings me to <a href=\"http://www.wrigley.com/global/brands/life-savers.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Lifesavers</a>. For the uninitiated, Lifesavers can be best described as the American <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_%28sweet%29\" target=\"_blank\">Polo</a>. Well, you don‚Äôt actually get Polo there, and you see Lifesavers everywhere. Frankly they don‚Äôt really come close on a taste front, but they make do. What Polo however doesn‚Äôt have, are‚Ä¶Lifesavers gummies! Those brilliant, mint-candy-with-a-hole-shaped soft gummies. So good. Case in point: when I touched down in the US last year for the first time in 4 years, the only thing I wanted oh-so-badly along with my Snapple Iced Tea obsession were, yup, the Lifesavers Gummies. And yes, they are joined by the 7‚Äì11 Big Gulp.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00012\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/9202ef0444.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc00024\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/34035403f1.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>The good news is, the ENOC petrol station store has started featuring Lifesavers, including the big versions, but in hard candy. Everytime I stop by to fill up the tank‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven if more than once a day at the same station‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI make a quick move into the store purely to check out the Lifesavers aisle in the sad-puppy-dog-eye hope. So far, I‚Äôve been disappointed.</p>\n<p>Lifesavers, are you listening?</p>\n",

Theplas are pretty much one of those all-purpose items. A staple for any travelling Gujarati, it can be eaten plain, with condiments such as <a href=\"http://pickleindmiddle.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">indian pickles (achaar</a>), yogurt, garlic paste (one of my favorites) or with curries much like a roti. In fact, the best description of a thepla is probably a flavored roti‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou find them in the plain/masala type, the methi (fenugreek), or kothmir (coriander) flavored types. With or without garlic. Adjusted to be soft and foldable or crisp and a little less foldable. Really thin, or slightly thicker. Every family has their own style and the actual recipe is ultimately pretty flexible.</p>\n<p>Enjoy (and if you need some, well, ask nicely¬†:P).</p>\n",

As part of my reconnaissance mission, I walked around the entire place to find out everything I could about the attractions before we decided which ones to hit, I passed by what looked like an absolutely delicious slice of pizza. I ventured in to find a cross between a restaurant and something like a business- or first-class lounge at an airport, really. As I normally do, the first thing I checked out was their oven. A nice little brick deal but with conventional gas flame. Not my ideal kind, but I can live with that.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06867\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/6dc0962363.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06870\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/9fe4254f62.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06868\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/f620d398eb.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06865\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/672e59d67c.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>After we were done with our ‚Äòadventure‚Äô on the world‚Äôs fastest roller coaster, I dragged everyone in for a slice. I LOVED the mushroom pizza, of which I sadly do not have pictures. Frankly, and I‚Äôm pretty vocal about this, I do not like stuff on my pizza. Pizza to me, is defined by the crust, the sauce, the cheese. Finito. Okay one exception‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämushrooms. Otherwise it‚Äôs just mozzarella and basil. Oh, heaven.</p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do enjoy the extravagant topped pizzas‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätake the Superbiotic at <a href=\"http://nkdpizza.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NKDPizza</a>, they‚Äôve actually done it well, but to me, those don‚Äôt fall under the authentic Italian Pizza category. Moving on.</p>\n<p>The Pizza at <a href=\"http://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/en-gb/shopping-and-dining/mamma-rossella.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Mamma Rossella</a> was very well done. The crust was light enough while being a tad crisp and sauce didn‚Äôt interfere with the rest. The cheese was just your standard mozzarella (ie, not the fresh kind) but it worked. One caveat is that they make their pizzas frequently and stack them, so they reheat when you pick up a slice (yes, exactly like they would in say, New York) but it was still pretty good.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06871\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/f478559a61.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Before I talk about my problem with this whole scenario, I need to give their Olive Oil a shoutout. Yes, you heard me. Their Olive Oil must have been imported but it was amazing. Fresh, olivey and it tasted like it had been cold pressed an hour or so ago. It was so brilliant I took a picture of the bottle so I can try to hunt it down.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06859\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/63402c62c3.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06880\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/b8f9925292.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Dsc06881\" src=\"http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/9bcdf24981.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Right, so about the price. This is a bit of a dissapointment. The only way to get a slice is by making an AED243 payment (AED225 to get into Ferrari World and a basic cheese pizza slice is AED18). You basically can‚Äôt decide to drive up to Ferrari World just to grab a slice. Which if you know me, is something I would do for a slice of good pizza. The drive, not the pay.</p>\n<p>I was able to find out‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsadly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat this was their only branch, and they are negotiating with the big digs at Ferrari World to try and either get the restaurant area accessible without attending the ‚Äútheme park‚Äù or get a mini-restaurant version outside the ticketed area; either of which are good for my purposes anyway. However, they did confirm they won‚Äôt be opening anywhere else for the moment, to maintain the exclusivity of being at Ferrari World.</p>\n<p>Mamma Rosella<br />Ferrari World, Abu Dhabi</p>\n",

I don‚Äôt quite like that fruit, I‚Äôm more of a berries, raisins, cherries, blackberries, strawberries, sultanas, pomegranates person. Did I mention strawberries?</p>\n<p>So a banoffee pie is primarily made out of bananas, cream, caramel and to give you a kick- chocolate is used as topping. The only trouble I had was finding a jar of ready made caramel. In Dubai, Nestle does not stock it‚Äôs very popular Carnation Caramel and I don‚Äôt know how to make it at home so I scoured Dubai for ready made caramel, spoke to friends, colleagues, even asked <a href=\"http://www.thequestioncompany.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Question Compan</a>y but in vain. Yes, I tried Marks &amp; Spencer as well but nothing! After days of searching and almost giving up, I *finally* located it at Carrefour in Oasis Center Mall. It was hiding among other jams and ready made spreads.</p>\n<p>There are some recipes that ask for the baking of the crust of the pie etc etc. I found an alternative to that. Here‚Äôs the easy recipe:</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n<p>*It really depends how big or small your tart tin is- I used a medium sized one so accordingly, the measurement is as follows:*</p>\n<p>- 1 small pack of Digestive cookies<br />- 3/4th cup of solid butter<br />- 2 ripe bananas (throw in an additional one if you are a banana fan)<br />- 1 jar caramel<br />- 2 cups whipping cream (or heavy cream)<br />- Chocolate, for garnishing- I used Flakes (easy way out)</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>\n<p>- Crush the cookies and mix with the butter. Press them into the base of the tart tin and keep it in the refrigerator for about 20mins or until it is set. It doesn‚Äôt take too long.<br />‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSpread spoonfuls of caramel onto the base until it is covered (a thin to medium layer of caramel should do just fine). Place it in the fridge for about 45mins to an hour.<br />- Once the caramel has set, cut the banana and top the slices over the biscuit and caramel base. Spread the whipped cream over the banana slices.¬†<br />‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTop this with chocolate shavings.</p>\n<p>And you are done!</p>\n<p>P.S. Again- this was the only (blurred) pic I could take before chowing it down</p>\n",

There‚Äôs a few new restaurants open there but this one place caught my eye: Chocopologie. Needless to say, the name alone was intriguing enough to get me in there within 5 minutes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/9336b-0euf_ddmnmbiq-pvc.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>After being shown around by a friendly waitress, I promised myself I would go there for brunch since they served all-day breakfast! (How exciting is that?! I love breakfast food!)</p>\n<p>So within the next few days, I was craving for some french toast. I usually make my own but I do get my extra lazy days when I‚Äôd prefer to just sit down at a nice place, order it and have it sitting right in front of me just waiting to be wolfed down. Okay, enough ranting now..</p>\n<p>I told my friend Hamna (Twitter Handle: @hamna_), who is a fellow chocolate-eating zombie, about Chocopologie and we decided to have brunch there. We were welcomed and seated by our waiter Ray, who was very helpful and friendly.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/3984e-0rr1dcbkeslnnluy2.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a7aeb-0mf2k8ng4lnnrlvpl.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Hamna had the omelette stuffed with tomatoes and cheese with a side salad</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a2623-0hxtyfbk_jekoauih.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/40461-0qwjgrvl4ibowuthv.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>I had the french toast with maple syrup and a side of strawberry salad.</p>\n<p>The verdict: <strong>YUM!</strong> That is all.</p>\n<p>Ray was also kind enough to offer us some chocolates to try.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/191e5-0h2gnhxz_gawc5klm.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>On the left: <strong>Patricia‚Ää</strong>‚Äî‚Äädark chocolate on the outside, white chocolate inside with sweet mexican &amp; ancho chilli filling.<br />¬†Top: <strong>Lauren‚Ää</strong>‚Äî‚Äämilk chocolate covered in walnuts with a pear ganache filling.<br />¬†Right: <strong>Kelly‚Ää</strong>‚Äî‚Ää64% dark chocolate with a strawberry and lemon tart filling (my personal favorite).<br />¬†Bottom: <strong>Charlotte </strong>(named after the founder‚Äôs sister)‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämilk chocolate with a basil and apricot filling.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/ab296-0zv0_bd3r_nvceau_.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>They were divine, to say the least</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, most of the chocolates are named after women. Ray informed us that they were women the founder had met on his travels around the world (<em>ahem</em>) in search for unique ingredients to use to make his chocolates.</p>\n<p>The interior of the caf√© has a Victorian theme, not my personal favorite style but quite interesting for a caf√©.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/81e4e-02ap0dyv2y-n8ly64.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/b8df4-0hn1qjoko8ofqgssi.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5fb96-05nvxtkkzs2lxwliu.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>Here‚Äôs some more pictures of what they have to offer from chocolates and pastries.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/e150a-0o8ge5zmli9kdae4b.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>These truffles are one of the world‚Äôs most <a href=\"http://en.news.maktoob.com/20090000463330/World_s_most_expensive_chocolate_comes_to_UAE/Article.htm\" target=\"_blank\">expensive</a> chocolates.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/5d656-01eiysli0-hn5agpo.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/7f751-0hdwt2nqab3xlmkji.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bf23b-0kd7a5yvo5tmehcqu.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/74112-0s3idiyddwuv3ie8n.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/3be42-0504nmptltimjmpf3.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/c2899-0uuh1woluoycpfcpe.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/2234a-0irf2ztbl_sylsl6c.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/08676-0xuod_2s4c8s27ehp.jpg\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/d2c51-077fpv1csglvzoj3z.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>I‚Äôll definitely be visiting them again soon to have a taste of some of their unique pastries.

I‚Äôve been to the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2023221&amp;id=10506803&amp;l=898d4cd7d9\" target=\"_blank\">Chaddsford Winery</a> in Pennsylvania, USA a few years ago with a full tour so I was looking forward to this, especially since India isn‚Äôt really known for producing wine.</p>\n<p>Opening with the fact that India is a ‚Äúnew world‚Äù wine country, our tour guide took us around the Sula Vineyard production facility, from the crushers to the fermentation tanks. The process seemed pretty similar to what I remember although this time around the tour guide had to deal with some gruelling questions on the quality of the wine and how it is maintained in India. I don‚Äôt think many were really satisfied with his answer, but I‚Äôll tell you this, the vineyard is beautiful to be in.</p>\n<p>While harvesting season is mostly in and around April, we had to deal with empty crushers and no bottling, but the weather on the other hand is probably a lot better this time of the year. After the tour, we stopped by the tasting room and the brownie just had to be tried. Sadly I was a bit disappointed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was more a chocolate cake than a brownie, and looked way better than it tasted. However the overall atmosphere and feel weren‚Äôt dampened much.</p>\n<p>The rest of the team nearby offered to try the house red wine of Sula‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe <a href=\"http://sulawines.com/wines/sula-reds/dindori-reserve-shiraz/\" target=\"_blank\">Dindori Shiraz</a>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich the tour guide raved about. I wasn‚Äôt fantastically impressed, in the sense, it didn‚Äôt give me the ‚ÄúWow, that is a great wine‚Äù feeling, but it was a good wine‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsmooth and tasted good. There was a hint of berry as promised.</p>\n<p>Overall, you should visit this place once, especially if you are in India. The tour and area seemed quite popular, with people swarming in over the weekend, with tons of little kids, much to our surprise. I‚Äôll tell you this though, it makes a great wedding location.</p>\n",

Of course, there were those moments where I walked impatiently in the kitchen looking into the microwave while it was still on to see if the concoction of flour, eggs, cherries, melted chocolate etc was rising up in each cupcake cover. The cakes, surprisingly turned out to be soft and fluffy. Not to boast, but they literally melted in the mouth. Not sure if cupcakes are supposed to be that way, but who cares! I didn‚Äôt go with the conventional icing and instead changed it to a very light version of cherry icing. So there you have it, mission accomplished.</p>\n<p>P.S.

			"content_text": "<blockquote>Emily Shardlow</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Last Updated: Dec 1, 2010</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ad20101201332749-3-i_live_in_the_f\" src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/ba180-0akcsqvzjeionbdyj.jpg\" /></figure>\n<blockquote><strong>Select a subject, and you can pretty much guarantee that someone, somewhere, is blogging about it. One of the most popular worldwide topics is food, and here in the UAE, we have our own burgeoning community of food bloggers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpeople of different ages and nationalities who share an ardent dedication to all things foodie, from tried and tested recipes to local restaurant reviews and essays on memorable gourmet experiences.</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Sally Prosser </strong><a href=\"http://www.mycustardpie.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>mycustardpie.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>‚ÄúI‚Äôve always liked writing, and find my style and rhythm when writing about things I adore: food, eating and cooking for friends and family,‚Äù says Sally Prosser, whose blog My Custard Pie offers a peek into the kitchen of a food-loving Dubai family. Prosser cooks attractive, inviting food, and peppers her posts with interesting observations in an open and conversational tone. The blog is updated regularly, with Prosser selecting recipes from her extensive collection of cookbooks, then adjusting them slightly to suit the demands of her family or the produce available in Dubai. She often accompanies the recipes with an anecdote, explaining why she has chosen them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Prosser also has a quest to find ‚Äúfood with good provenance‚Äù in the UAE, sharing little nuggets of information about local food developments and detailed information on restaurants (not so much reviews, more descriptions).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Despite saying that she is still pinching herself over the positive response, it‚Äôs easy to see why this blog has garnered numerous local and international fans. It is for good reason, after all, that Prosser is regarded as something of a local food guru by her fellow UAE bloggers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Dalia Soubra </strong><a href=\"http://www.daliaskitchen.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>daliaskitchen.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>When you are already the co-founder and head baker at a successful bakery (Kitsch Cupcakes), writing a food blog in your spare time shows real passion. Yet Dalia Soubra adds to her site frequently and says she was inspired to start blogging when customers began making requests for her recipes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Now Dalia‚Äôs Kitchen, which she describes as her ‚Äúown little online food journal‚Äù, is filled with simple, achievable recipes that have a fresh, modern feel to them. Soubra draws on her Syrian roots and her time spent in New York and Paris for inspiration, and the dishes featured range from healthy dinners to interesting breakfasts, with some seriously indulgent cakes in between. Each recipe is accompanied by a few lines of text and it seems that Soubra is something of a home food stylist; many of the photographs are stunning‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääclean, appetising shots, with a hint of Donna Hay about them. This blog is well worth a browse, even if you don‚Äôt end up making a dish from it (although I suspect you might).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Laila el Baghdadi </strong><a href=\"http://www.lailablogs.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>lailablogs.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Spurred on by the belief that people underestimate Arab food, or simply don‚Äôt look beyond the hummus and tabbouleh staples, Laila el Baghdadi started lailablogs.com two years ago. Originally from Pakistan, but born and raised in the UAE, el Baghdadi has a wealth of knowledge to draw on, and her blog features recipes that have been passed down through the generations. The really impressive thing about this blog is its comprehensive nature. El Baghdadi posts pictures of each step of the cooking process, which is very helpful if you are making an unfamiliar dish for the first time. In a nice interactive touch, she also has a ‚Äúrecipe requests‚Äù section, which allows readers to suggest dishes that they would like her to experiment with and provide recipes for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>El Baghdadi has big plans for the future of the blog: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to translate everything into Arabic so that my site is fully bilingual,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOver time, I‚Äôd like to make it possible for users to create a personal profile so that the site can predict their tastes and make recipe suggestions‚Äù.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Arva Ahmed I Live in a Frying Pan </strong><a href=\"http://www.foodonymph.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>foodonymph.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The header on this blog reads: ‚ÄúTurning up the heat on my crazy obsession with the world of food‚Äù and Ahmed is certainly true to her theme. I Live in a Frying Pan reads like a diary of culinary experiences, featuring tried and tested recipes, restaurant reviews and details of the food sampled on her travels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Having previously lived in New York, Ahmed says the experience opened her eyes to the multitude of ways in which food can be experienced: ‚Äúnot just eating and appreciating it, but reviewing, discussing, describing, debating, visualising, photographing‚Äù. As a result, when she moved back to Dubai, she decided a blog was the best way to keep these conversations alive‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äúto chronicle them over time and share them with others‚Äù.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>She seems to have achieved her aim because her personality and dedication shine through. Her detailed posts are fascinating to delve into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Rajani Mani </strong><a href=\"http://www.eatwritethink.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>eatwritethink.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Rajani Mani describes her exclusively vegetarian blog as a means of sharing ‚Äúfood that tells you stories, food that‚Äôs handed down by generations of grandmothers, happy food that revolves around conversations and laughter‚Äù.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Although it does feature a fair few recipes (from a variety of different cultures), this blog is about far more than that. There are links to food-related articles written by Mani, photo essays and contributions from different culinary enthusiasts currently travelling the globe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The blog has an intimate style: ‚ÄúWith the food and the recipes came slices of my life laid out to be picked bare by people I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she says. You learn about her reasons for being a vegetarian, or how a certain dish made its way into the family repertoire, and it is precisely these opinionated, personal snippets that make the blog so absorbing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Anja Schwerin </strong><a href=\"http://www.anjasfood4thought.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>anjasfood4thought.com</strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you are in search of interesting, inventive recipes, with the emphasis on health, then Schwerin‚Äôs blog, Anja‚Äôs Food for Thought, is a great place to visit. Motivated by a desire to eat more healthily, in 2008 the mother of two made a conscious decision to cut refined sugar and flour out of her diet. She began scouting the internet for nutritious, wholesome recipes and was inspired by the food blogs she discovered. With an increased desire to experiment with natural ingredients, Schwerin started her own ‚Äúpersonal food journal and cookbook‚Äù and began posting recipes and pictures, often experimenting with vegan, vegetarian, low-sugar or raw food.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Her 15 years‚Äô experience as a picture editor are certainly reflected in the quality of her photography; dishes are beautifully presented and many of the photos are striking. She tends to add to the blog two or three recipes a week (estimating that each post takes around two hours, plus cooking time) and says that it is ‚Äúa hobby that I really love‚Äù. The blog has around 10,000 visitors per month, and Schwerin puts its success down to ‚Äúposting healthy and tasty recipes regularly, together with mouth-watering pictures‚Äù. It‚Äôs certainly worth browsing through if you want to cook up some restorative, nutritious and unusual fare.</blockquote>\n<p>via <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/featured-content/channel-page/lifestyle/the-uaes-best-food-blogs?pageCount=0\" target=\"_blank\">thenational.ae</a></p>\n",

Trying to figure out different ways to make the cheesecake set is an interesting if difficult feat. I trawl through cookbooks religiously on a regular basis, for a little light reading of course, as any aspiring cook would do.</p>\n<p>Though some would bake the humble cheesecake for the new york style, others put gelatine in to set the cream cheese. I have found the perfect alternative, inspired by the <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/bite-sized-demonstration-strawberry-delights\" target=\"_blank\">bite sized demonstration</a>, using white chocolate in the cream cheese helps it to set firm. Whats more, it actually tastes of that creamy velvety chocolate and adds a new level of richness to the cheesecake, as opposed to the tasteless nature of gelatine or agar agar.</p>\n<p>Whatever the event, try this cheesecake on for size, you will not be disappointed. Different variations of the fruit coulis can be tailored to your own tastes, as per my previous <a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/mango-cheesecake-i-just-couldnt-resist-the-te\" target=\"_blank\">mango cheesecake</a>, but remember not to overdo the sugar content. A cheesecake should be sweet and I prefer the coulis a little tart to offset the balance of sweet cream cheese and crunchy nutty biscuits with sharp fresh fruit. Remember folks practice makes perfect, keep experimenting and find the balance that suits you, if mascarpone (which is amazing by the way) is too cheesy for you, stick to Philadelphia. If you would like a baked cheesecake, experiment with the recipe that uses eggs, but always follow these simple rules.</p>\n<p>1. Biscuits: usually a biscuit with a crunch, digestive biscuits, hobnobs, shortbread.</p>\n<p>2. Cream Cheese: Philadelphia, mascarpone, cottage cheese, low fat cream cheese is all fine.</p>\n<p>3. Toppings: I love berries on cheesecakes, and most recipes point you in this direction, but look at the fruit you have in your fruit bowl, I found a mango and tested out my hypotheses; largely being that cheesecakes are amazing with most fruits, as long as you consider the sharpness and sweetness of each fruit on its own and alter the sugar content of your cheesecake to match. Chocolate is also a great topping. Use your imagination.</p>\n<p>4. Have fun. There is no point of being in a kitchen if you are not going to have a little fun, a little drama when the utensils crash and the blenders hum, is what makes the cheesecake or any other dessert turn out beautiful.</p>\n<p>With regards to the title ‚ÄòHow to cure a cheesecake infatutation‚Äô: if any of you ever figure this out, please do not contact me. I like to be blissfully unaware of the fat and calorie content of my cheesecakes, for what is a dessert if not a little indulgence every now and then.</p>\n",

White chocolate clusters. Little bites of heaven. Indulgence at its best. There are no rules, so go crazy. You need good quality White Chocolate, Brazil nuts, (sultanas or raisins if you fancy) and some biscuits. The biscuits need to be crushed, the white chocolate melted, and Brazil nuts chopped. Mix together to form a gooey white chocolaty mess. Spoon into bite-size clusters on baking paper (or as per picture into mini cup cases), leave to cool, and then decorate with milk/dark chocolate.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a winner every time. Its uncomplicated, fun to try with children, and requires very little effort or fuss. So get chocolaty, I promise you these little bites of heaven are as scrumptious as they look.</p>\n<p>12 oz white chocolate</p>\n<p>10 oz dark/milk chocolate (for decorating)</p>\n<p>7 oz Brazil Nuts (chopped)</p>\n<p>7 oz Biscuits (crushed up)</p>\n<p>note: raisins, sultanas, cereal, sweets, chocolate chips can also be used, be inventive and have fun.</p>\n",

After going through the selection of desserts, I decided to devour a Molten Chocolate Cake (who can say no?)</p>\n<p>Now before you go all how-can-you-commit-a-sin-against-the-holy-grail-of-molten-chocolate-cakes(Chillis to the non enlightened crowd) I merely wanted to try it. Besides, I didnt have much choice a that time of the night. So how was it? Bad.</p>\n<p>Dont get me wrong here. Molten Chocolate cake in my opinion, has to be made in a particular manner- Rich chocolate cake with a soft, liquid chocolate center. Oh, and served hot.</p>\n<p>Naturally when a friendly(sarcastic) waiter asked if I would like my cake heated up, I was taken aback.. But of course it needs to be served hot! Cardinal rule in molten goodness isnt it? So it was popped into a microwave and was merrily swirling around while I made myself comfortable, ready to dive into the warmth of molten chocolate heaven, with rich, moist cake and oozing molten center (yes I was dreaming Chillis here)</p>\n<p>What I ended up getting was lukewarm cake‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI admit it was rich and moist and not crumbly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith a HARD center. You read that right, it was not a liquid center, rather like having a bar of chocolate stuck into your cake. I finished the cake bit and left the center. Sigh.</p>\n<p>Apart from bursting my dream sequence bubble, Im sure I could hear a snigger or two from the Chillis.</p>\n<p>Lesson: Never mess with Chillis.</p>\n<p>PS: I was so disappointed, I only took one photo.</p>\n",

One of the Vadas looked like a cute little pig. Hence the decoration¬†:)</p>\n",

I probably couldn‚Äôt single out a specific reason, but there‚Äôs a lot going on for the place. A nice traditional ambience, really friendly staff and great desserts. Well the food‚Äôs good too, but that has to be the case if we‚Äôre going to talk about it! A quick mention about the Pope room (pictures of which you can see towards the end). The Pope room is a private seating room that can hold 15‚Äì20 people and is decorated with pictures of the Popes through time. It‚Äôs even got a nice Pope chair and huge revolving table to pass the food around.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôve never been there before¬†??? something they ask you¬†??? they‚Äôll walk to you to the table via the kitchen, which is a fun part of the experience considering you‚Äôre greeted by smiling chefs and waiters as you walk through.??</p>\n<p>Buca is considered a family style restaurant, meaning that¬†??? contrary to normal places where each person gets their own plate¬†??? everything is served in huge sharing portions, and comes in 2 ‚Äúsizes‚Äù: for 2, and for 4. Their Caesar Salads are among the best, their garlic bread is amazing and all the food is very fresh. But most of all, I *love* their tiramisu. Just like everything else, this comes in a huge portion that you need at least two die-hard tiramisu fans to finish, but it‚Äôs such a delicious and cold blend, it leaves you wanting more, and more. Thank goodness it comes in a size that‚Äôs capable of being a one person meal all by itself!</p>\n<p>All in all, my experience was the same as it had been when I last visited the place over three years ago¬†??? great atmosphere, amazing food &amp; desserts and great company!</p>\n",

That‚Äôs right. Chocolate lovers, the time has finally arrived!</p>\n<p>With 100% pure chocolate pipes running throughout the outlet, big drums stirring live chocolate all around and canisters of chocolate all around, the instant smell of pure chocolate hits you as soon as you set foot into Max Brenner.</p>\n<p>You get a 10% discount for correctly guessing the number of times I‚Äôve said the word ‚ÄòChocolate‚Äô in this post, by the way.</p>\n<p>We started off with a milkshake and a hot chocolate. I‚Äôm mentioning these in particular because I loved the mugs it came in. The hot chocolate came in a ‚Äòhug mug‚Äô¬†??? no handles¬†??? so you literally had to hug it with your hands to drink, which is perfect for hot chocolate! The milkshake arrived in a nice tall glass with Drink Me written all over. What was really cool is the spurts of chocolate all around the glass.</p>\n<p>Overall, the food was quite delicious. Since we went as a group, we attempted a pizza, a burger and a panini. They all came out delicious, and considering their specialty is chocolate, that‚Äôs rather amazing. Oh, and that first picture¬†??? none of us had that, so I‚Äôm not really sure what it is. But it looked so good, we snapped it off someone‚Äôs plate 0:)</p>\n<p>The money for life, chocolate for the soul box was what they served the bill in. Very nice touch.</p>\n<p>Definitely recommend a visit to anyone that‚Äôs in town. And don‚Äôt forget to walk around and see their chocolate selection, particularly their chocolate syringes. As Barney Stinson would say, Dee-lightful!</p>\n<p>PS I was kidding about the discount.</p>\n",

To the uninitiated, Reading Terminal Market is best described as a farmer‚Äôs market with an awesome hotchpotch of options. True to its style, and enclosed in a just-right closed space within Center City Philadelphia‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää12th and Arch to be precise‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäReading Terminal offers a wide variety of foods, from baked goods to flowers, meats &amp; seafood to produce and a number of eateries.</p>\n<p>Due to my intense desire to fill as many attractions as I could in my short stay, we hit RTM (sorry, I can‚Äôt be expected to type out the entire name each time, and copy-paste stops my smooth flow of typing, but I digress) rather early in the morning, but the place was quite bustling for 8.30 a.m. on a weekday. Since it‚Äôs right of Philly‚Äôs Market East station, it‚Äôs got a perfect location for a quick breakfast, a drop by for lunch during a busy day, or a stopover for supplies to take home at the end of the day. They also offer student discounts on Sundays &amp; Tuesdays, so if you are one, or know one, that‚Äôd be the day to go.</p>\n<p>The market is a delight to the retina, and¬†??I‚Äôve tried to capture as many of the colors as I could.</p>\n<p>We stocked up on some basic supplies comprising organic vegetables, and attempted a place called the Basic Vegetarian Snack Bar for a quick bite. Our reason for picking them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey had every conceivable dish you could think of, from the chili burger to the traditional Philadelphia Cheesestake‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut made with organic vegetarian ingredients. The best description on their menu was for the Soy Chicken Salad (paraphrased)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif we didn‚Äôt tell you it was soy, you would never know. We have a confession to make‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey were 100% right. It was so good, we took a pound of it back home for a later snack. I‚Äôll drop another confession: along with the garlic and olive bread we picked up, this quantity did not last beyond lunchtime.</p>\n",

Well, here we are, you pessimistic person you, our first negative review.</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>At the behest of a close friend who had also never tried the place, my first lunch in Philadelphia after three years was at a place creatively called Currito Burrito, right on the??<a href=\"http://www.drexel.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Drexel University</a>??campus by the residence halls. This was housed in a new food court structure that had come up after I left the city. Oh, the excitement.</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>Curbing my natural instincts to go to Subway‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääprimarily because Subway in the US kicks Subway in the UAE‚Äôs behind by a mile and a half‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI went for the ‚Äúnew Burrito place that is really good.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Some considerations later, I went for what they called a Mediterranean Burrito, comprising rice, a Black Bean hummus and some other condiments. I wasn‚Äôt overtly impressed with the look and feel, or the way he was actually making my burrito at all. And the burrito, right, let me say it was the worst burrito I‚Äôve had, and that graciously includes??<a href=\"http://www.naihar.com/black-bean-burritos\" target=\"_blank\">my own home-made version</a>.??</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt really know what else to say except to avoid the place, and particularly the Mediterranean option. The burrito was dry, the rice was‚Ä¶is stuffy an appropriate word? And the flavors just did not work.</p>\n<p>??</p>\n",

Needless to say, we all have our favourites, and this is particularly busy haunt for the Asian communities in the North West.</p>\n<p>For starters we ordered a meat feast of mixed grill, which consisted of lamb and chicken kebabs, tandoori chicken, lamb chops. This was accompanied by one of their signature dishes and a particular favourite of mine, as I have made it many a time at home, Thai mango salad. This salad is not as authentically Indian as it is Thai, but nonetheless a great accompaniment to the starters. The salad consisted of a carrots, peppers, onions and mangoes topped of with coriander, and a honey mustard dressing with red chili and pepper.</p>\n<p>For mains we ordered Akbari chicken Masala which was extra hot, far too hot for my liking, but my father loved it; and Lahori ghost which was delicious, the lamb was perfectly cooked and the spices perfectly chosen to compliment this dish. the balance was just right. This was all served with fresh nan bread which was soft and brushed with butter. The new desserts menu was the highlight of my evening, I opted for the Apple tarte, another special on the menu, however it was a big letdown, as fussy me could tell that the apples were pre-prepared and had gone slightly brown. The family ordered traditional Indian falooda (a milk based dessert, with sago, rose water, and dumplings of kulfi ice cream inside it), the chocolate waffle meltdown which was amazing and probably one of the best things on the menu, and a mint parfait which was as standard as prepackaged ice cream desserts can get. The biggest fail on the menu I felt was the lack of locally sourced produce, mainly in the form of Huntley‚Äôs Ice cream, whose farm is a mere 1 mile up the road.</p>\n<p>The ambiance was great, with a family oriented atmosphere, to a restaurant which is always busy and very lively of a weekend. If you‚Äôre in the North West of England, why not try this countryside gem, nestled in between dairy and sheep farms midway between Preston and Blackburn. It promises to be a find, and will not disappoint.</p>\n",

			"title": "Review: Seesmic for iPhone",
			
			"content_text": "<p><em>Originally posted at the Shufflegazine Blog (no longer exists)</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/2a712-0ptbpuz3zoe68rcrx.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>The awesome people at <a href=\"http://www.seesmic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seesmic</a> finally got around to launching their <a href=\"http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone application</a> last week.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been a fan of Seesmic from rather early days. To me, they edged out <a href=\"http://www.tweetdeck.com\" target=\"_blank\">TweetDeck</a> as the Desktop Twitter client to have at the time, having launched support for multiple accounts and integrating <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> support before anyone else did. Since then I‚Äôve moved on to <a href=\"http://www.seesmic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seesmic Web</a>(I‚Äôd recommend it any day considering it doesn‚Äôt use Adobe AIR. But I digress‚Ä¶)</p>\n<p>I‚Äôll leave the app comparison for another day, but I think Seesmic‚Äôs <a href=\"http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone app</a>‚Äôs first rendition is quite good overall.</p>\n<p>The first thing that struck me about the app was the seemingly blazing response time, both in terms of loading new information and response using the touchscreen. By this I mean that a lot of apps I use (I‚Äôm not talking just Twitter apps) are effectively hung until their update/reload is complete‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis does not seem to be the case here. While I wait for the latest tweets to be updated, I can still navigate around the app freely.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs talk unique features. First up is the panel view. This is a fairly neat way of using one app to encompass multiple services. The panels are cleanly organized and easy to navigate. You can even setup a panel for a specific twitter search you follow, making it accessible with one click or swirl. You can navigate between panels by either using the panel button or merely side-swapping them. I thought it was cool that when you are looking at the panel, the faded screenshot is an actual live version of the feed on that panel.</p>\n<p>Currently, Seesmic‚Äôs app allows you to quickly sign in to your <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ping.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">Ping.fm</a> accounts. Sure there is a facebook app, but from a ‚Äúfeed‚Äù point of view, Seesmic does a good job. I will not be surprised to hear additional services being integrated, least of all <a href=\"http://www.foursquare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Foursquare</a>, which Seesmic recently incorporated into their Web client. Seesmic also integrates with Evernote, allowing you to send tweets directly to <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/Login.action?targetUrl=/Home.action\" target=\"_blank\">Evernote</a> (in addition to e-mailing them) if you want to save them. Seesmic also has a separate ReTweet tab in the main window, allowing you to view all twitter-style RTs in your timeline as a separate feed.</p>\n<p>In comparison to other clients I‚Äôve used though, I see a few lacking features.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I‚Äôd have thought that it would have the ability for app sync, at least with Seesmic‚Äôs Web client &amp;mdash for unread tweets, messages and the like. Seesmic‚Äôs app is also missing the conversation view, which is bizarre considering this is a standard feature on other apps and Seesmic themselves introduced this on their Web client. It is almost infuriating if you‚Äôre trying to track back on a conversation if you have to keep tapping the ‚Äòin reply to‚Äô button to see each tweet. This should have been covered from the get-go.</p>\n<p>I also miss having unread counts. This is probably more or less a luxury feature, but I think we as a crowd are just used to having that. I‚Äôm perfectly okay with not knowing this for the regular feed, but not having this for @-replies and DMs is unnerving. They also did not include in-line previews (which adds clicks, not desirable on a phone app).</p>\n<p>Having said that, I‚Äôm quite happy with their first version. I can‚Äôt be impressed enough with the speed of the app, and for a first run, they‚Äôve done a good job. In my history with <a href=\"http://www.seesmic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seesmic</a>, I find that they listen to their users and are quite dynamic in terms of releasing new features, so I expect the same to carry over to their iPhone app. If that happens, don‚Äôt be surprised if Seesmic‚Äôs <a href=\"http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone app</a> becomes the go-to app for aggregating social networking, beyond just <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a>.</p>\n",

It‚Äôs quite unfortunate actually that they‚Äôve shut down their branches anywhere except Abu Dhabi. With a menu that boasts a variety of options for every meal of the day, it is a bit of a wonder why they didn‚Äôt exactly take off as a concept.</p>\n<p>It also helps that there aren‚Äôt too many options in Abu Dhabi, unlike Dubai, where you can stop for a bite or a quick drink and also be able to work. Although for the size of the place, having exactly 2 power outlets is quite a negative point (no pun intended). If you aren‚Äôt lucky, you‚Äôre stuck without one, which is useless if like me, your laptop battery doesn‚Äôt have much of a life. Surely they‚Äôve heard of a multiple outlet??<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_protector\" target=\"_blank\">surge protector</a>???</p>\n<p>Pictured above is their Egg salad with Spring Onion Mayo sandwich pair.

Let‚Äôs not forget the crispy??nachos to go with them. Oh, and the fajitas, burritos, quesedillas smothered in cheese, beans and sour cream.??Divine.??</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>With??Spanish influences on their??cuisine, Mexican food uses a lot of corn (think nachos), peppers (think jalapeno) and beans in a variety of different ways. And??<a href=\"http://www.ontheborder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">On The Border</a>??doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to choose!</p>\n<p><strong>Guacamole Live, captured on video:</strong>??</p>\n<p>[wpvideo s1gOqgtX]</p>\n<p>With their varied menu concentrating on salads, appetisers, and different types of mexican wraps, you can be assured to spend a good amount of time pondering over what to order. Many of the dishes on the menu can be made into vegetarian options and they aren‚Äôt fussy about it.??It‚Äôs a must to try their guacamole live. Freshest ingredients, made to perfection live in front of you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs a treat for the eyes, and the tongue. Every dish is made with impeccable perfection, served in good time, and for sure you will not end up with??a soggy taco. The drinks and mocktails are refreshing and fruity, and the best for a hot summer‚Äôs day. Service is good, the staff is friendly and do dont hover over your table all the time, but are attentive and knowledgable.??</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ontheborder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">On The Border</a>??is a great casual dining experience for all Mexican food lovers. Soak up the bright atmosphere, be the noisiest in the crowd and no one will mind, this place offers something for everyone. What sets??<a href=\"http://www.ontheborder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">On The Border</a>??apart from other Mexican restaurants is their ability to stick to true Mexican taste and yet provide their fun, quirky personal touches!</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>Oh, and we did not have place for dessert.. so another review once we get upto it.</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>As they say in Mexico, Buen provecho!</p>\n<p>??</p>\n<p>Notes: <a href=\"http://www.ontheborder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">On The Border</a>, a US chain, is located at <a href=\"http://www.dubaifestivalcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dubai Festival City</a>.

How awesome can that get? I‚Äôm not a fan of cupcakes primarily because of the dollops and dollops of unnecessary icing they put on the actual cake (HEY! I‚Äôm entitled to freedom of speech, okay?). The last time I had a cupcake, I had to cut off the 3 inch icing and eat the cake with chocolate bits in it. Happy I was.<br />¬†So anyways, getting back to the ice-cream cupcake. Deeeelicious. The flavor is Oreo Creme Filling. There are layers of ice-cream including chocolate and an extremely thin layer of cake that the ice-cream melts into. All this heavenly goodness is covered in a cupcake shape chocolate coating. Sigh.¬†<br />¬†I couldn‚Äôt take a pic of the actual ice-cream cupcake because I was too busy eating it but the one highlighted in red in the above image is what it looks like¬†:) Try it out- they have different flavors.</p>\n",
