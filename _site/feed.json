			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/07/23/anchor-on-free.html\">Manton Reece</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anchor seems to be going for the YouTube model. They want a huge number of people to use their platform. But the concentration of so much media in one place is <em>one of the problems</em> with today‚Äôs web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cannot stress this line enough:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Massive social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have too much power over writers, photographers, and video creators. We do not want that for podcasts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I want podcasts to be as mainstream as possible. I <a href=\"https://amaeya.fm\">live and breathe them</a>. But, as Manton points out, the platforms that have been running an it‚Äôs-free-and-we‚Äôll-raise-money-elsewhere model should have taught us big lessons by now.</p>\n\n<p>They went downhill for users, and sold out. They had to do both of those things, there was no other model for them. They landed up damaging the medium they made mainstream.</p>\n\n<p>Take YouTube, for instance. It is the only place you go to both create and consume video content. YouTube has complete control over the medium itself, and that‚Äôs the problem. It translates to control over the creators. What happens when you‚Äôre done with YouTube and want to take your viewers elsewhere? Or if YouTube deletes a video, or your account, even if accidentally. What is your recourse to retain what you‚Äôve created?</p>\n\n<p>What does it matter if you outrage over an algorithmic timeline being the only option on Instagram? Everyone you know is there, your followers are there, and although Instagram (finally) allows you to export your content, what can you do with that so that people who want to see your photos can continue to do so easily? Nada.</p>\n\n<p>The models that these platforms sit on can only be run by advertising. Advertisers are their customers, and the platforms will continue to tweak algorithms to ensure best value for their customers, not their users. Which is why Facebook continues to be brazen about all of its data misuse, and why those privacy approvals <a href=\"https://techtree.show/5\">were vague to begin with</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I haven‚Äôt even gotten to ownership, but those thoughts are in a <a href=\"http://www.chirag.biz/2018/07/12/social-media-actually.html\">separate post</a> if you‚Äôre inclined.</p>\n\n<p>‚Äî-</p>\n\n<p>I cannot but be firmly in the camp that believes this model cannot be the default, and will harm the medium it sets foot in. I get that a content creator is bound to find it difficult to pay monthly subscriptions when compensation seems unlikely or at least years away. But I also know how great it is to be able to tell listeners they can listen to me in any channel they prefer, to own my shows in their entirety.</p>\n\n<p>When I switched hosts last year, I was able to simply redirect my domain &amp; feed, thereby retaining my data <em>and</em> the people listening to my shows without them having to change the way they consumed them.</p>\n\n<p>Why shouldn‚Äôt it be like that?</p>\n",

			"title": "Social media & actually owning what you publish",
			
			"content_html": "<p>Ah, social media. The thing that (theoretically) democratized everyone‚Äôs voice. That allowed two-way communication impossible to do beforehand if you weren‚Äôt in a niche circle.</p>\n\n<p>The thing that cost you the ownership of your own content.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Do you remember in the 90s, when everyone active on the web had their own blog? Even those that didn‚Äôt self-host and used platforms like <a href=\"https://blogger.com\">Blogger</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">Wordpress</a> (or <a href=\"https://https://www.movabletype.org\">Movable Type</a>), you wrote under your username (me.site.com) and eventually were able to point your own domains there. This sounds like a simple thing, but it kept you in control of you what you published. If you‚Äôd wanted to change platforms‚Äîanything from you having an issue with the way the platform ran, to you were just bored‚Äîyou moved your domain over and your readers just continued to find you, or follow your owned RSS feed in a reader.</p>\n\n<p>Then came the Facebook era. The Twitter era. Instagram. Medium. Platforms that broke through a significant problem with traditional blogs: writing in silos. Social media platforms redefined engagement and discovery of other creators, bringing anyone and everyone into one space. People could just follow you and you could share your links seamlessly.</p>\n\n<p>And then you stopped writing on the blog altogether. You just posted on Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram. The platforms made posting easier and easier, and starting silo‚Äôing alternative platforms. Like when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/\">Instagram removed Twitter card support &amp; Twitter stopped showing you previews of Instagram photos</a>. Twitter eventually bought out and integrated their own photo services. Facebook doesn‚Äôt let you embed content outside of the platform either; you either link it and live with it, or upload the video separately to Facebook. And therein lies another part of the problem. They want to keep you in, make it harder for you to use alternatives for even a part of the services, either buying out or copying feature sets.</p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, a couple of guys went about building a blogging platform designed to take on the complications of Wordpress and provide sturdy posting &amp; inherent collaboration. It was called Posterous and I migrated almost instantly. Spoiler alert: <a href=\"http://www.chirag.biz/2012/12/03/with-a-heavy.html\">Twitter bought out Posterous</a> and ‚Ä¶. shut down the platform.</p>\n\n<p>So when Twitter or Instagram decides to shut down your account, <a href=\"https://boffosocko.com/2018/02/16/facebook-is-censoring-my-notes/\">censor you</a>, or otherwise prevent you from accessing it or taking your username away, there‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ nothing you can do about it. <a href=\"https://amaeya.fm/techtree/e/361a2347383d3c/\">Facebook‚Äôs been selling everything about you</a> for years, and Twitter is equally guilty. Twitter is also horrendous about handling harassment, spam and hate. Rumors about <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-recover-a-Twitter-account-from-Shadowban\">Twitter arbitrarily ‚Äòshadow banning‚Äô users</a> ‚Äî stopping their tweets from showing up in timelines of followers for a while ‚Äî¬†continue.</p>\n\n<p>In unrelated news, Medium recently &amp; quietly <a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487-Custom-Domain-FAQ\">ended the ability to map your domain</a> to Medium.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this comes as news to you, that‚Äôs a good thing.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Enter the Open Web. The Web as it should have been built. As a series of integrated platforms allowing anyone to everyone to own their content, to retain flexibility to use services they wanted. Platforms that let you brand your content to you, and don‚Äôt arbitrarily decide whether your account is deemed worthy to be verified. That allows you to <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\">Publish on your Own Site &amp; Syndicate Elsewhere (POSSE)</a>. And those that allow you to take your data out in a format compatable to some standard when you want to leave. A group of talented people have been hard at work at developing both the standards &amp; principles over at <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb.org</a> and I recommend you check it out.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I‚Äôve migrated all of my writing over to <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> a few months ago. Today I publish on my own blog that I own and pay for, push to services like Twitter and Medium, and can continue conversations there, as well as within the Micro.blog timeline of connected blogs. Should anything happen with some of these services, I still have my original posts. A full backup of my blog, with individual posts, CSS etc sits in <a href=\"https://chiragnd.github.io\">GitHub pages</a> as a failsafe with Micro.blog itself, or in case I want out. None of this required any complicated setup, they‚Äôre features of the platform and its adherence to the IndieWeb Principles.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôll be elaborating more about ownership &amp; the IndieWeb as time passes, but I wanted to share some of my motivations and why I‚Äôve been feeling so strongly about these platforms recently. You don‚Äôt have to do any of this, but I do think it‚Äôs time you‚Äîand everyone‚Äîthinks about it: where you are posting, do you actually own your content, and are you in an environment that encourages ownership, fosters conversation &amp; responsibility vs just a cacophony of echo chambers, spam, hate &amp; likes.</p>\n",
