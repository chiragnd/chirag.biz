Rate-limits should be the same for an app like Icro as they are for the official Micro.blog app, for example.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the last few weeks, I‚Äôve been thinking about blogging and content, and how the breakup of traditional ‚Äòblogs‚Äô have cost us, the netizens, a whole lot.</p>\n\n<p>The more time passes, the more I appreciate the philosophy that sits behind Micro.blog. Every decision won‚Äôt be perfect and/or popular, but it is good to see that the driving principles of it all are rooted in the <a href=\"http://www.indieweb.org\">right place</a>. Manton‚Äôs been extremely open and communicative about it, so I hope that part scales as this gets bigger. With <a href=\"http://www.chirag.biz/2018/05/16/steve-straza-the.html\">the way Twitter is handling third-party apps that built the platform</a>, the timing is perfect too.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(To be clear, we‚Äôd offer this for free. Our business is blog hosting.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm glad to see Micro.blog‚Äôs monetary stream is both clear upfront and doesn‚Äôt require surrendering user privacy.</p>\n\n",

But over the years, Twitter has become something I don‚Äôt recognize anymore, a place where hate and intolerance and crass commercialism have found a welcoming home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a side note, a nice insight into understanding micro.blog as a Twitter user‚Äîhow they‚Äôre same in some ways, and how they‚Äôre different.</p>\n\n<p>Her Twitter experience though is not far away from mine; some of my closest friendships &amp; collaborations have their origins on the network, but ‚Ä¶ here we are now.</p>\n\n<p>Jean doesn‚Äôt get into this much but a long-standing problem with Twitter is how they‚Äôve stifled third party development, <a href=\"https://blog.chirag.biz/goodbye-twimbow-33be1b392cce\">over</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.chirag.biz/more-twitter-api-restrictions-now-for-win8-b14d5ba783fa\">over</a> and <a href=\"http://apps-of-a-feather.com\">over</a> again.

The last few real Twitter apps are now bending under this weight.</p>\n\n<p>Considering <a href=\"http://www.chirag.biz/2018/04/08/massaging-egos-facebook.html\">Facebook isn‚Äôt in a particularly great place currently</a> either, hello to an free-er, open-er Web.

On the company blog, Facebook‚Äôs chief privacy editor wrote that instead of being ‚Äúspread across nearly 20 different screens‚Äù (why were they ever spread all over the place?), the controls would now finally be in one place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs a long read but a great piece that highlights the right things. Any other company would have lost trust years ago but Facebook continues to enjoy the advantage of the ‚Äògravity‚Äô effect of having 2 billion users.</p>\n\n<p>My co-host Partha <a href=\"https://coffeeandicedtea.com/techtree/5\">made a super important point last week</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These products have been made by the same people who lived with the same sort of theory that [our generation] grew up with [‚Ä¶] they understand the importance of this privacy and they‚Äôve been building on top of this to try and massage the egos of all the newer generations [‚Ä¶] to try and make sure they‚Äôre comfortable about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The more I think about this, the more spot-on this is. People who watched‚Äîushered in, even‚Äîthe social media era and understand the privacy implications could have gone about it in two ways: ensure that even those who do not understand this are protected, or help transition the vary ones into being more comfortable about sharing. Facebook has gone the latter way too often that it‚Äôs now part of its core, making it impossible to be anything else.</p>\n",
