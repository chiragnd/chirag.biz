      <p>After <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35718711445/dear-reliance-you-need-work" target="_blank">writing a long &amp; annoyed letter</a> to <a href="http://www.rcom.co.in/Rcom/personal/home/index.html" target="_blank">Reliance</a>, here’s what they offered:</p>
<blockquote>Dear Customer,</blockquote>
<blockquote>We regret the inconvenience caused to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is with reference to your e-mail regarding “Waiver For Service Faults”, registered under the Service Request ID 142081510. Please note that your complaint has been resolved with the resolution, the net not working complaint registered has been resolved within the given time period.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hence we are unable to process the waiver.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Looking forward to serve you in the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Yours sincerely,</blockquote>
<blockquote>Siddhesh Pawaskar</blockquote>
<blockquote>Broadband Customer Care</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reliance Communications.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You may contact us through any of the following means:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Phone: 1800 3000 7777 from any phone (Toll free) or,</blockquote>
<blockquote>022–3033 7777 from any phone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Email: <a href="mailto:broadband@relianceada.com" target="_blank">broadband@relianceada.com</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Website: <a href="http://www.rcom.co.in/" target="_blank">www.rcom.co.in</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can book your service complaints online at <a href="http://cnm.reliancecommunications.co.in/cnm/web/genTTCreation.jsp" target="_blank">http://cnm.reliancecommunications.co.in/cnm/web/genTTCreation.jsp</a> OR through IVR while calling at contact center.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can view your bills and make payments online through <a href="http://myservices.relianceada.com/launchAMSS.do" target="_blank">http://myservices.relianceada.com/launchAMSS.do</a> for all RCOM services. Please register yourself on the portal. For difficulties in registration please write to <a href="mailto:myservices@relianceada.com" target="_blank">myservices@relianceada.com</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Please note that your message will not be delivered if it exceeds the size limit of 5 MB per mail (including attachments).</blockquote>
<blockquote>Requesting you to please create a shorter message (including attachments) with size less than or equal to the allowed mail limit in all your future communication.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The information provided is based on prevailing terms and conditions of the company, which are subject to change without prior notice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This electronic message transmission contains information from Reliance Communications &amp; is confidential or privileged. The information is intended to be for the use of the individual or entity named above. If you are not the intended recipient, beware that any disclosure, copy distribution or use of the contents of this information is prohibited. If you have received the electronic transmission in error please notify us immediately.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, their signature is that long, including their pleading request to keep our attachments small. Aaanyway, here’s what I responded:</p>
<blockquote>The fact that I had to register multiple complaints during the same week is indicative of the fact that my problem was NOT resolved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Your engineers fill out and close complaints as they please with no consultation with the customer; just because they say it’s closed doesn’t mean the problem is resolved or that your customer is satisfied. I would not have to register 3 separate complaints if the problem had been resolved in 24 hours and it amuses me to read such rubbish.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have, as a result, posted my grievance against Reliance online on my blogs and elsewhere and intend to take this further.<br /><br />Please have a manager call me to discuss disconnection of my service at home and office (I have 2 connections) as I do not wish to deal with Reliance any further if this is the attitude.<br /><br />Suggest you speak to your team leader Durgesh and Supervisor Ujvala as I have spoken to both of them during this problem and I’m confident that they were not contacted to get information at all.<br /><br />I do NOT consider this problem resolved, and I expect a manager to contact me by PHONE if you have any hope. I will contact your customer care to set up disconnection of my services tomorrow morning. I’m guessing you must be glad to lose customers this way.<br /><br />Chirag</blockquote>
<p>I wonder…but yea.</p>
<p>There is no regret in the inconvenience they caused me.</p>
<p>Finally, this morning:</p>
<blockquote>Dear Customer,</blockquote>
<blockquote>We regret the inconvenience caused.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is with reference to your e-mail regarding “Waiver For Service Faults”, registered under the Service Request ID 142081510. Kindly note that as informed earlier your complaint has been resolved with the resolution, the net not working complaint registered has been resolved within the given time period.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hence, we are unable to process the waiver.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Yours sincerely,<br />Abhijit Athavale<br />Broadband Customer Care<br />Reliance Communications</blockquote>
<p>How does one deal with such friggin’ brilliance? I don’t believe they are looking beyond a ticket closed by an incompetent engineer saying he fixed the problem without budging from his seat.</p>
