        <h2><a href="/2012/07/11/microsoft-and-ballmer.html">Microsoft and Ballmer</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I have my reservations (I believe I tend to be vocal about them) about Microsoft, but there’s no denying that they were revolutionary for the PC industry in terms of reaching it out to the masses.</p>
<p>There’s also no denying that Ballmer just annoys me. I’m not really sure why. Maybe because his portrayal in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0168122%2F&amp;ei=HyL9T_epBMaGswayv-mjBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEyrXWehCYAIYhKg4en4t7dRxj2A" target="_blank">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a> made him sound like an unimaginitive frat boy riding a wave (no offense to frat boys..or waves). I mean…</p>
<blockquote>But we are not going to let any piece of this [go uncontested to Apple],” Ballmer shouted. “Not the consumer cloud. Not hardware software innovation. We are not leaving any of that to Apple by itself. Not going to happen. Not on our watch.</blockquote>
<p>Shouted. Interesting.</p>
<p>I get his point but if they’re going to now drive all their energy towards chasing Apple, they’ll never get there. Apple is known for their secrecy anyway, and they might get lucky but they’ll purely be playing the chasing game.</p>
<p>This is hot on the heels of news that Microsoft is looking at its first loss-quarter since 1986. A <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/26660666648/microsofts-financial-black-hole" target="_blank">holy shit moment</a> indeed.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/07/07/how-we-ran.html">How we ran product at Posterous (by @agarwal)</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>A little context. My deciding factor to use <a href="http://www.posterous.com/" target="_blank">Posterous</a> for blogging was actually a video of its founders talking about their drive and process behind putting it together (sorry don’t seem to have a link for it anymore). There are some key feature differentiators why I have continued to use Posterous — and expanded my use to a <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/" target="_blank">food blog</a>, alongwith using it on a <a href="http://blog.cognitoit.com/" target="_blank">corporate level</a> — but it started with that talk, about their motivation. It seems to factor when I decide on using a product or service, and why I land up sticking with it — understanding its history, the founders and their motivations.</p>
<p>I digress. I came across an interesting post by Posterous’ founder, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/agarwal" target="_blank">Sachin Agarwal</a>, who posted some thoughts about how the ran product management at Posterous, a good read:</p>
<blockquote>I loved the process we had at the end of Posterous’ life. We were working hard, shipping new features weekly, looking at metrics (but not too much!), and we were mobile first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The process also ensured we were working on what we thought was the most high value feature possible, while still dealing with tech debt and bugs. It’s a balance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We had accountability. We knew when we were making mistakes or running late. It made my life a lot easier. It made board meetings easier. I could go on vacation and know the company was powering on without me.</blockquote>
<p>Go on, read the whole post <a href="http://sachin.posterous.com/process" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Someday.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/30/twitter-vs-linkedin.html">Twitter vs LinkedIn</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>So LinkedIn <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/29/sharing-on-linkedin-twitter/" target="_blank">ends their twitter sync partnership</a>. Or, technically, I suppose Twitter ends their LinkedIn partnership. Either way though, I’m kind of relieved. No, really, logging into LinkedIn to see a clone of my twitter feed was a little annoying, especially since I knew I was losing out on pure Linkedin content.</p>
<p>That said, I’m wondering if this will become a downward slide for Twitter and its content/developer partnerships. Reading <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience" target="_blank">their blogpost</a>, they mention recently enforcing their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms" target="_blank">developer rules</a>, which contains clauses like developers shouldn’t deliver a similar experience to what twitter is already providing. While the intention may be right — it would theoretically push developers to get creative about creating twitter clients — it would also start causing problems for businesses who sole product is a Twitter client which mimics the Twitter experience but does it much better (and typically with much needed features).</p>
<p>One of my favorites — no, wait — my favorite iPhone twitter client is <a href="http://stone.com/neue/" target="_blank">Twittelator Neue</a>. It’s a smooth experience, with my <a href="http://eye.chirag.biz/ooh-helvetica-love-my-day-is-complete" target="_blank">favorite font</a> and awesome previews and conversation views available. But based on the rules, Twitter could say they are delivering a similar experience — with a feed for your Twitter activity, despite the fact that Twitter’s own client is a lot worse (being forced to use Twitter’s RT method is not the only problem I have with it).</p>
<p>But I’m digressing. The point is that Twitter — in a fairly decent move on some level to protect their brand and experience — might start alienating developers and other networks if they keep this up. I’m sure LinkedIn was not pleased.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/28/presentations-at-google.html">Presentations at Google I/O 2012</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>There are enough posts this morning doing the rounds about Google’s I/O 2012 keynote that I don’t really need to add to that. But I did want to put some thoughts down on the presentation itself.</p>
<p>Because it bothers me on some level. It bothers me that despite <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/" target="_blank">Chrome OS</a> being out there for a while (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chrome_OS_21.0.1172_Aura_Dev.png" target="_blank">looks decent too</a>), and official Chromebooks shipping for over a year, Google couldn’t use one to do the presentation. (They instead used a Macbook whenever they needed a browser, in case you were wondering). Subconsciously, and maybe this isn’t true for everyone, but the only thing it tells me is that they couldn’t pull of or be happy with doing the presentation on Chrome OS. ‘Oh we love Chrome OS, but for serious presentations, we just use, you know, Apple.’</p>
<p>Take example 2. When talking about <a href="https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts" target="_blank">Project Glass</a> — kudos to Google on what everyone agrees was one of the best tech product launches, ever — the presenter mentioned how it was the future. And how, today, when people want to search, they just pull out their phones. Cue a high res picture of someone using an iPhone.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m a Chrome boy. I live out of Gmail. I actually like how G+ is shaping up. But why couldn’t Google display an inherent confidence in their own products to actually *use* them for their own keynote presentations?</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/24/i-can-finally.html">I can finally rave about pizza in Dubai again.</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img alt="Dsc02506" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/74de27b5ac.jpg" /></figure>
<p>I’ve continued to stay heartbroken since <a href="https://naihar.com/pizza-pizza-a58e8e51702e#.eb7cevh1t" target="_blank">my favorite pizza place in Dubai</a> shut down almost two years ago, back when my photo skills were absolute bullshevic (thanks, Madagascar 3!). The photos are only marginally better now, granted, but I shudder at <a href="https://naihar.com/mango-and-curried-chickpea-salad-9ce4d2c02c36" target="_blank">those woeful pictures</a>, ew.</p>
<p>As I was about to say, throw me a lightly charred pie from a wood-fired brick oven, that cooks in 3 minutes and I’ll be your fan for life. It’s what defines a real pizza for me. I’ll typically take a look at a picture (or the real thing) and almost instinctively decide whether I’ll like the pizza or not. I had searched frantically for a shot when Jamie’s Italian introduced pizzas at their Dubai outlet a few months ago before I agreed to try them out. Speaking of which, I need to blog about that experience soon eventually.</p>
<p>So it was little surprise that <a href="http://foodiva.net/2012/05/a-slice-of-napoli-pizza-in-dubai/" target="_blank">Foodiva’s post about Rossovivo</a> caught my eye. The review was definitely positive and the pictures got me excited. Could it be, could it? Alas, I had to hold my hopes when the dinner being organized there a few weeks ago was moved after the guest list expanded to a size beyond Rossovivo’s current capacity.</p>
<p>But let it be known that I pestered incessantly waited patiently until another visit was scheduled last weekend. And while I want to let the pictures speak for themselves, we all know that’s not really going to happen.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc02504" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/335bde7ac6.jpg" /></figure>

<p><em>Pic 1</em>: The Bufalina. A thing of beautiy. <em>I wish I’d realized that the menu was not out of the shot enough, but this is where you thank me for revealing 87.5% of the delivery number before the end.<br />Pic 2: </em>The Raffaele. Who knew pistachio on a pizza could work?<br /><em>Pic 3: The Marinara</em></p>
<p>The star of the show — for me, anyway — was the Bufalina: Buffalo cheese, tomato, basil. You could taste the difference in the quality of the cheese instantly and, coupled with the crust, it made for the perfect minimalist pizza I enjoy. I jumped at the tomato and garlic Marinara — my mind forgetting that it also meant there was no cheese on it — but the sauce was the right amount of fresh and tangy that I ate it all up anyway.</p>
<p>The surprise of the show — was the Raffaele: pizza with, wait for it, pistachio! Named after the Chef himself. Frankly I thought it was outright bizarre but I did try a little piece — we all live for bizarre, don’t we? — and I’ll admit the chef gets points for creativity. Pistachio and cheese do seem to go together despite my initial objections, and the women at the table absolutely loved it.</p>

<p>Love the fact that you can watch your pizzas being made at the table.</p>
<p>So finally, a pizza place I can rave about again. It helped that someone used me as a landmark with a taxi-driver to spot the place while I stood outside frantically calling everyone waiting quietly for everyone to arrive; nothing like an ego boost just before you’re treated to amazing buffalo cheese pizza.</p>

        <p>A rather good post by MG with some spot-on points about the Surface. I think it’s a good attempt, but it hinges on a lot of variables, and continues to amuse me that MS is now in the hardware business. Guess who won after all.</p>
<blockquote>On the surface — see what I did there? — the thing seems compelling. It’s a tablet that runs Windows, and Office, and has a keyboard. There’s no denying that the keyboard/cover hybrid is a smart thing to try.<br />Two years ago, I think this thing would have been pretty competitive. Today? Color me very skeptical.</blockquote>
<blockquote>…</blockquote>
<blockquote>Windows is not free. OEMs will be paying Microsoft to directly compete with — wait for it — Microsoft.<br />Cluster, meet fuck.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But hey, at least Surface for Windows 8 Pro comes with a pen. To quote a guy I once met, “If you see a stylus, they blew it.”</blockquote>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>My initial thoughts with the </em><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/tablet-pcs/XE700T1A-A01US" target="_blank"><em>Samsung Slate PC Series 7</em></a><em> are available </em><a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>What a difference a couple of weeks can make I suppose. As promised during my <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35212207739/first-impressions-samsung-slate-pc-series-7" target="_blank">initial thoughts</a>, I pushed myself to break routine and use the SlatePC as my primary device over two weeks. Despite the fact that I’m not a traditional Windows fan as such (without getting into it here, the OS just bothers me over time, as any regular Linux or OS X user will tell you), the SlatePC is a good bet, particularly as a work device, with some caveats.</p>
<p>To start with, it’s the software/OS and not really Samsung that’s the issue here, as I’ve already raised. Windows 7 just does not allow you to really enjoy the SlatePC’s potential. With it, I ran the device almost entirely as a desktop computer, plugged into the dock with an external keyboard/mouse. I was unable to really use the touchscreen — either because my fat fingers couldn’t hit the x in one try ever, or because I kept playing whack-a-mole with the on-screen keyboard. The SlatePC though does come with standard specs you see in today’s laptops, so it did function well in this combination.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/49ee8-0epamj4tpoqdm17sg.jpg" /></figure>
<p>But that changed when I moved to Windows 8. For those who are ambitious, Samsung has officially <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/windowspreview/" target="_blank">put up a page dealing with this migration</a> (which I think is smart in and of itself) with drivers for the SlatePC. I did face an issue with the touchscreen not being responsive, but the should-be-patented-process of uninstall driver, resintall driver sorted that out. And the device came alive once the metro layout was in place. Granted, this isn’t a Windows 8 review — which is probably a good idea to put through at some point.</p>
<p>Win8 also made the hardware seem better than Win7 did. For example, battery life jumped for a barebones 2.5 hours to almost 4–5 hours of use under Win8, which made portability that much better. I’m sure Samsung is already looking at putting together some apps to the Windows 8 Store, which might make development easier compared to builing their own custom ‘home screen’ they have on the Slate for Win7.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/92d7f-0clgtsjwrdfi64k-b.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Much better touch experience with Win8.</em></p>
<p>So the net verdict: If you’re a Windows user and need a change or are trying of lunging around a 5-kg laptop around with you, with Win8 you should seriously consider this form factor. I’m sure the release of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/" target="_blank">Surface</a> by Microsoft is going to add to the disruption, but I find it interesting that Samsung has already put together a device in this form factor that is a great fit for organizations, particularly with travelling employees.</p>
<p>I realize I’ve said that (professional/work device) a few times, but that’s because at AED4,500, I feel the price point is a bit steep to become an mass regular Joe device. But this price is actually comparable to current business grade laptops that fall in the same range with the same specs. Let’s not forget how much my shoulder thanked me as I carried just this to and from meetings. (With a shoutout to <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2591582&amp;topic=1693469&amp;ctx=topic" target="_blank">Chrome sync</a> and <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> for making my to-and-fro use of two full fledged devices really easy).</p>
<p>In the real world though, my co-workers and customers eyed the device intriguingly. One of my customers felt it was a great idea to adopt the SlatePC considering they spend the same on bulkier 14" laptops that every travelling user they have complains about. And I’ll concede that note taking directly to soft copy made me immensely happy. As did interviewing and marking off CVs directly on screen. No, no screenshots of that are available, sorry.</p>

<p><em>So I’m geeky. Like you didn’t know.</em></p>
<p>There you have it. A good piece of hardware, a pretty looking device too and a tricky OS. Win7 might not let you get everything out of the device, but with Win8, there is tremendous potential. I don’t think Samsung really intends this to be a professional device though (purely based on current marketing and the way it’s listed under ‘Home’ on their site), but I do believe that’s where it holds its true potential.</p>

<p>Just saw the <a href="http://blog.picplz.com/day/2012/06/01/" target="_blank">note from Picplz</a> saying they intend on shutting down in one month. I’m guessing they’ve figured it just makes sense to get out of the business with an inconvenience to a subset of users than fight the growing monopoly that is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100318398827991" target="_blank">Facebook+Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve been a user for some time, I’m not an avid user as I tend to just post pictures here instead. However, I thought the least they could have done was to provide a link allowing users to download multiple pics or say 30–50 at a time, which I’m sure wouldn’t have killed their time. Their solution of ‘we’re providing a download link for each individual picture’ is just…annoying.</p>
<p><em>Update, June 16:</em> While I doubt my blogpost had anything to do with it, Picplz came out a couple of weeks later with a single archive link of all pictures, which they intend to keep available until September 3. Yay.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/06/02/first-impressions-samsung.html">First Impressions: Samsung Slate PC, Series 7</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>Note: I was given a Samsung Slate PC Series 7 review unit this week to play with. Okay, maybe those weren’t their exact words, but how else would I describe it?<br /><br />Note 2: I intend to write this as a series of two posts — First Impressions — covering Day 1 with the Slate and an overall review.</em></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/6a063-0ifkbzsjfn1jcqc3b.jpg" /></figure>
<p>I’m a little confused, actually. I’m not entirely sure where Samsung intended to place the Slate PC Series 7 in a consumer’s lifecycle and I think if they figure that bit out, they’ll have done well.</p>
<p>To clarify, I don’t think it’s a bad device at all, but I’m unsure how this fits into my laptop+smartphone life. However, it is already clear to me that a comparison of the SlatePC with something like the iPad is not possible — the two do not deal with the same market or have the same goal at all. So I’m going to do my best to keep the iPad away from this discussion. The SlatePC is a PC replacement for someone who wants to be fairly mobile, where you want the full functionality of a PC operating system but the mobility of something like the iPad. So I think this is something that would compete with the Macbook Air for market share.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ea457-0qrmgsxhohrdephe9.jpg" /></figure>
<p>Staying on point, I can see how the SlatePC would be a good alternative to the PC for someone like me, who moves around, works with wifi where I can, considering it runs a full version of Windows (Win7). At the same time, this is where the problem is. For a devicefocused on having a touch screen, Win7 is extremely cumbersome to use with touch. Thankfully, the device does come with a compact docking station and external bluetooth keyboard (I’ll say it again, thank goodness, the on-screen keyboard in Win7 is pure torture to use with my fat fingers, and using it with the Slate pen feels like a game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole" target="_blank">whack-a-mole</a>). But this is a software problem.</p>
<p>Going back to the hardware, the packing is simple and clean. I wish they’d put in a little crevice to unattach the device though — I ended up having to flip the whole thing over to get the Slate PC out. All in all, not a bad looking device on your table by any means.</p>
<p>But with Win7, the device acts more like a regular PC than a portable device, forcing you to carry around the keyboard/mouse and dock for usability. What’s more, without any data capabilities, you’re reliant on a wifi connection or one of those USB 3G modems, so I didn’t really benefit from having it with me while I was stuck waiting on my EmiratesID appointment.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/a08c3-0qng3dbelzcx5hx4j.jpg" /></figure>
<p>So my first impression is that this is a good device from a hardware standpoint. Powerful, pretty robust, a little awkward sizing compared to other devices in this form factor — but not something that you cannot get used to. However, the software aspect is a major problem with Win7 not being ideal for touch/on the go.</p>
<p>That said, there is potential if packaged with Win8, where you’d have both aspects — touch and regular PC use — covered and the Slate PC has the hardware to run this — something I hope to test over the next couple weeks, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>The best thing about traveling is getting a chance to savor the local cuisine. The foodie in me plays a big role in deciding where to go on a holiday. And yes I do travel with a list of restaurants ready!</p>
<p>On a recent trip to India’s capital Delhi, I was of course blown away by the amount of good food available. So much so that I did manage to put on a few kilos, but it was much to my delight!</p>
<p>Pictured here is the ultimate chicken tikka from a traditional Indian roadside eatery- Rajinder da dhaba. The thing about these quintessential dhabas are although you might not like to sit there and eat, you cannot resist the amazing aromas each one carries. Rajinder Singh is known among the Green Park area residents for this scrumptious, succulent and perfectly spiced chicken tikka. Served in a little bowl made of dried leaves, with cool mint and yoghurt chutney on the side, his chicken morsels will melt in your mouth leaving behind an irresistible aftertaste of tandoori spices. Like so many other traditional eateries, this one started out as the eatery for taxi drivers, truckers and assorted transport people. Now though, you can sit in his air conditioned hall and enjoy.</p>
<p>Oh and I only managed one shot because I couldn’t wait to tuck in!</p>
