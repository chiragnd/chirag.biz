<blockquote>“I’d like nothing more than to apologize in person to everyone we’ve let down, but as you can see, many of our users are rarely home at this hour,” said Google cofounder and president Sergey Brin, pointing to several Google Map street-view shots of empty bedroom and living room windows on a projection screen behind him. “And, if last night’s searches are any indication, Boston’s Robert Hornick is probably out shopping right now for the spaghetti and clam sauce he’ll be cooking tonight.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Either that, or hunting down that blond coworker of his, Samantha, whose Picasa photos he stares at every night,” Brin added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have been very critical of Facebook’s change from private to public, but as a owner of a web service, I completely understand where Mark is coming from. How many of us are stuck at the point where we started — not been able to imagine what our service would be like if we started today. Our services are vintage the year which they started. Flickr is vintage 2004 when it started. Basecamp is vintage 2004. Delicious is vintage 2005. While they remain great services, there has been no re-imagining of the service so that it fits into the web of 2009–2010.</blockquote>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>Originally posted at the Shufflegazine Blog (no longer exists)</em></p>
<p>Even though this isn’t a psychology blog, it is always interesting to understand how we, as humans, react. And I’m referring particularly to technology. The reason for this train of thought is the hype and the reaction surrounding the release of Apple’s iPad last week.</p>
<p>Quite obviously, it’s hard to be upbeat about the name. I can understand Apple’s thought process — iPod, iPhone, so yeah: iPad. But they do have the iMac, so it isn’t just an i, P nomenclature.</p>
<p>Apple today has a unique fan following created by themselves. A set of classy, elite devices, in their own price and performance range, and a product lock, which tends to put some people off. Yet you find yourself in a publishing house, or even in management offices, and you will see over and over again, how Apple computers have found their way into the elite space. Most people that take the move towards Mac’s never look back. Apple customers may not be as large as the Microsoft customer base but they sure are way more loyal.</p>
<p>So what is it about Apple? Is it the classy, white/black, chic persona they give their devices? Is it the aura that comes with owning a Mac or an iPhone? Is it Steve Jobs? It’s probably a combination of all of these things and a bit more.</p>
<p>Last week’s release of the iPad marks another step in Apple’s revolution. Sure, there are a large number of folks were disappointed or feel that the iPad was all hype and no value. People said the same when the iPhone came out and look at it… today it has even become the choice of phone for the enterprise. Apple brought in the iPad because they felt that there was a gap between the smartphone and the laptop and iPad is a device that does combine features of both.</p>
<p>My points of concern? The camera. I’m really not sure how and why they didn’t put in something that obvious.</p>
<p>Consider, a tablet PC with video conferences, a 10in screen with 3G. It can easily become the portable device for the enterprise as well. The potential is there.</p>
<p>And Apple doesn’t go without putting some strong thought into their creative process. All the iPhone apps will run out of the box with the iPad. I think that was a well-thought out decision. The pricing is definitely a marker as well, considering most people expected a device of this calibre to start at $1,000.</p>
<p>Apple even launched their bookstore to go hand-in-hand with this. If Apple can cover a large range of books in a good range of languages — to the level that the iTunes and App store have reached today — people will adopt the iPad. Even if they’ll never want to call it that.</p>

        <p>For people I’m close to, I’ve always tried to do something special on their birthday. Generally, this involves getting them something they’ve expressed desire for in the past. It’s always a pleasure looking at their expression for something I managed to remember :)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Sometimes birthdays feel like a grand celebration. Other times, they feel like just another date. The reason for this message is just to say, that no matter what happens in the world, everyone should get at least one wish on their birthday. So here’s a quick shoutout to anyone having a birthday, whether or not it’s a grand celebration, or just a quiet evening. You are worth it.</p>

<p>This post, for obvious reasons, is dedicated to L.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>Originally posted at the Shufflegazine Blog (no longer exists)</em></p>
<p>I’ve been using Google Chrome as my default browser for some time. What amazed me from the start was the sleek interface. Getting rid of the extra menu bars was, in my opinion, one of the smartest design moves on a browser. The extra screen space was phenomenal, yes every little pixel of it. There were others, such as one single box (affectionately called the omni-box) for address and search (and admin options), but it was the overall interface and screen space that really caught my eye. Speed is also something I’ve enjoyed with Chrome. I honestly can’t really tell the difference between how fast a page loads against, say, Firefox, but the speed with which Chrome as an application operates — from starting up to opening tabs — is definitely an improvement over other browsers.</p>
<p>Chrome, for those who don’t know it, is based on an open source project called Chromium. As part of the Chromium project, Google has made the browser available on Linux and Mac platforms in line with the Chrome releases, as a developer edition. Ofcourse this meant that while its stability was not guaranteed, test versions of the browser have been available for some time. Last week, Google <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chrome-for-mac-goes-beta.html" target="_blank">finally announced</a> the release of the beta version of Chrome for the Mac. This finally puts Chrome into contention against Safari and Firefox on the Mac. In addition, Google has unveiled a larger and constantly growing extensions gallery, to rival Firefox extensions.</p>
<p>The question is then, can Chrome do what it did on the PC — move into the top 3 browsers in a year? Users are already raving about its speed, but stability is something that has to be proven over time. In addition, it seems that extensions are not yet available for the Mac, something Google will have to fix soon if they want to really sway hardcore Firefox users.</p>
<p>One thing’s for certain, IE is nowhere in the picture.</p>

        <p>So another year has come and gone. Honestly, this year, I had no expectations. Outside of going to buy myself a new desk chair, no presents were in line either.</p>
<p>It started around 11:40 p.m. when some of my twitter buddies started their countdown to the birthday, and happy birthday songs exploded at midnight — an extremely pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Followed by a morning breakfast and my day couldn’t have been better. While it didn’t entirely get much better due to a hospital visit at the end of the day, the wishes and messages definitely made me smile.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Geekfest 2.0, the following night, where I got wished in person by a lot of tweeple, only to then be surprised by an ice-cream cake by someone who knew that I had to spend the previous evening at the hospital. Sometimes, you are surprised when you least expect it.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>A pretty common sight around Turkey, the pole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simit" target="_blank">Simit</a> bread. They’re actually quite good, but again I’m a bread lover. I could do with a better cheese selection though.</p>

        <p>Right, so no surprises the posts have been few and far between.</p>
<p>I have been embracing the online revolution in the meantime. Twitter and fb. It’s amazing what an online presence they give you — we’re also trying that out company-wise, so I’d like to see how we are able to work that into the scheme of things.</p>
<p>Other than that, there’s not a lot. Work is pushing along, things are moving in routine, and there are signs it might pick up. But at least I’ve been on the move a little. Driving around always seems to keep me happy.</p>
<p>Right, speaking of the revolution, I’ve also adopted the iPhone. Phenomenal gadget in its own right, albeit with a few flaws. But they’re fairly new, and there’s good scope for improvement. I’d be very interested to see what happens in June.</p>
<p>Finally — and this seems to be the common theme around the world — is the need for a vacation. My last attempt at it didn’t quite work out, heck, it didn’t anything out and I’m still recovering from that. At least I know not to visit a gym the first day of vacation. Ever.</p>
