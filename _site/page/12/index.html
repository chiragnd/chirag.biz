        <p>The news continues with Twitter’s new API policies continuing to cut down on Twitter clients.

<p>In this case, without an existing Win8 client already (and no immediate release date either, even if one is in the works), users will suffer. And by suffer, I mean try to use Twitter web.</p>

        <figure><img alt="image" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/31777-0bkq8xm_f-nh3vvo0.jpg" /></figure>
<h4>Quick Facts</h4>
<p><strong>Brand</strong>: Samsung<br /><strong>Model</strong>: NX1000</p>
<p>20.3MP APS-C Sensor, 8fps, 1/4000 shutter speed, 1080p fullHD video recording</p>
<p><strong>Standard lens</strong>: 20–50mm <br /><strong>Weight</strong>: 0.22kg (without battery+SD card) <br /><strong>Other lens options</strong>: 60mm f/2.8 Macro, 16mm f/2.4 Ultra Wide Pancake, 85mm f/1.4</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras/EV-NX1000BFWUS-specs" target="_blank">Full spec sheet</a></p>
<p><em>Note: I received the Samsung NX1000 camera as a review unit.</em></p>
<p><em>“I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw the pics in your gallery. I don’t want to even begin to believe that a compact camera can do those shots.</em></p>
<p><em>I won’t believe it.”</em></p>
<p>When I first heard about Samsung’s new <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/topic/nx-system" target="_blank">NX series</a> line, I was a little intrigued. Samsung is not exactly known for its cameras, although that also means that I went in with no expectations.</p>
<p>When I actually managed to take a few pictures with one, I was surprised. The Samsung NX1000 holds its own when it comes to photography as a compact camera for those wanting the options of inter-changable lenses while still carrying around a more portable device. And before you ask, yes, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras/EV-NX1000BJPUS" target="_blank">it does come in pink</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the camera is definitely recommended as a quality 20.3 megapixel camera that takes great shots whether in all-auto (SMART) or various less-auto/manual modes, at a competitive price in its range. The NX1000 does have features such as Wi-Fi, i-Fn and inbuilt filters that those cameras don’t; so it’s a good buy for the photo aficionado that wants something in that price range and quality.</p>
<p>All other things being the same, I think its worth discussing the three elements that give the camera (well, the series, considering other cameras in the Samsung NX range have them as well) a little edge.</p>
<h4>Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>Samsung has incorporated Wi-Fi capabilities into the NX series. This allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload pictures to an offsite storage (currently integrated with SkyDrive)</li>
<li>Upload pictures to social media (Facebook, Picasa)</li>
<li>Extract pictures to your smartphone (iPhone, Android)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the share-the-second-I-take-a-picture generation, these are must-haves, although my own use of this during the review period wasn’t excessive. The Skydrive and social media integration are pretty self explanatory. The smartphone option is enabled with a Mobile-Link app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilelink/id505414479?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsungimaging.filesharing&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a> that allows you to connect to the camera as a hotspot, and offload pictures to the phone. This is actually quite nice, since you can edit them a bit if you like, and shuttle them off via social networks or email.</p>
<p>Setup was rather easy so it wouldn’t be a pain for the non-network-savvy. Just a few clicks, and you’re on your way.</p>
<figure><img alt="image" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/d060b-0usi8grgc0wpp_wbx.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Pulling photos onto a smartphone was a breeze</em></p>
<h4>i-Fn</h4>
<p>I used this feature the most out of the three. The Samsung smart lenses have an outer ring that allows you to activate menu controls to select options such as ISO and filters (see below) by rotating the ring rather than clicking the buttons. This made for a seamless experience during shooting without losing your grip, particularly if you want to take the setting to an extreme value.</p>
<h4>Filters</h4>
<p>In today’s Instagram age, filters are a smart add-on, no pun intended. The camera comes built in the a variety of smart filters such as vingetting, fish-eye, haftone dots, old film, etc. If I were to use filters, this’d be a better way I’d do it since you can actually position your shot to meet the filter rather than hope it works out in post-processing/uploading.</p>
<p>Filter selection was easy enough and didn’t take more than a minute to master.</p>
<figure><img alt="Vingetting Filter with Samsung NX1000" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/16c27-0fk9uxbjtt5it3jzb.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Using inbuilt filters: Dragon Mart, Dubai with Vingetting</em></p>
<p>Now onto the usual.</p>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>I was happy with the build quality. While the body is plastic, it doesn’t feel cheap and is steady to use even when sitting in a moving vehicle (and no, I don’t mean while also driving!).</p>
<p>Something was bothering me about the camera as I held it, but it took me more than a day to figure out what it was. I was about to take a macro shot of my favorite photography subject — that’s right, food — and as I brought the camera close to my face, I realized… the NX1000 does not have a viewfinder at all. Your interface with the camera is entirely with 3.0" LCD screen. This wasn’t tough to get used to but it took me by a little surprise as I’m someone that uses both for photography. That said, I’m sure the lack of a viewfinder helped with the form factor and I imagine most ready shooters will not mind.</p>
<p>There’s no built in flash, but an external flash is provided. I’m personally not a fan of using a flash in the day-to-day photography I do, so was happy with the decision since I’m sure it helped keep the weight that little bit down.</p>
<h4>Low light</h4>
<p>For a compact camera in its range, the NX1000 seems to handle low light shooting rather well. Both twilight shooting and indoor shooting were simple enough to do without too much modification; the auto-ISO settings seem to work well, and I was able to get a decent shot in with the ISO set at 12,800 (max setting). Granted, the picture was a little noisy but it did mean that a lower setting would have worked fine.</p>
<figure><img alt="image" src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/4cd3a-025x0gcaohfnl0djk.jpg" /></figure>
<p><em>Low light indoor shooting looks good too. Hummus!</em></p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>With the right amount of manual and effective auto controls, the NX1000 is a good camera for people of any expertise level, and the build is a plus because it’s definitely something you’ll be happy carrying around. I think the NX1000 will compete directly with some entry level DSLRs on price — such as the Canon 550–650D range — and while they don’t exactly fall into the same class of cameras*, it’s a comparison that will happen considering the price point. The NX1000 carries the edge in portability and savvy features such as Wi-Fi and filters, while the DSLR would probably still be more appealing to the traditional photographer with more specific requirements.</p>
<p>You can see more sample shots in the picture gallery below. As the opening quote suggests, the shots are pro-photographer (and big Canon-fan) approved!</p>
<p><a href="https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true" target="_blank">https://chiragnd.jux.com/653345?sans_gallery=true</a></p>
<p>PS I’m currently looking at the other end of the same range, the NX20, so stayed tuned for a review soon!</p>
<p>— -<br />*The NX1000 is a mirrorless camera. Mirrorless cameras tend to be more portable and compact compared to their DSLR counterparts, but suffer a bit in action-shot making. At the end of the day, these are two different systems although the price points are starting to line up. If you’re interested, <a href="http://www.mirrorless-dslr-guide.com/mirrorless-vs-normal-dslr.html" target="_blank">this link</a> has a good overview of the difference.</p>

<p>With my photography skills receiving an update over the last year, and Navratri just wrapping up, I thought it might be a good chance to give the awesome Mohanthal another papparazzi session (here’s <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/mohanthal" target="_blank">last year’s take</a>). Mohanthal continues to be one of the few indian sweets I’m extremely partial to, although I only tend to like the version you see pictured and one that is distributed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambaji" target="_blank">Ambaji</a> when we visit their for prayers. The naihar version is topped graciously with pistachios and flavored with a hint of saffron. Mmm-mm good!</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/09/12/goodbye-twimbow.html">Goodbye, @Twimbow</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>On some level, I guess I knew this was just a matter of time. Today <a href="http://www.twimbow.com/" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>, my favorite desktop Twitter client by some distance, <a href="http://blog.twimbow.com/2012/09/12/the-rainbow-vanished/" target="_blank">called it a day</a>.</p>
<p>To give you some context, Twimbow did something pretty unique in organizing your social media experience, primarily over Twitter, by allowing you to color code the people you follow, providing a nice visual experience. Ofcourse it was more than just that, their 3-column approach was way better than the one-column-per-item-style most clients follow and so on. More about this in my <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/twimbow-a-social-media-client-with-something" target="_blank">blog post from last year</a>.</p>
<p>Just as they were ready to launch version 2.0 however, the glitches began. I had a chance to speak to a couple of their developers, and learnt that the new Twitter API restrictions were at the bottom of it all, and there were in talks to see if this something that could be relaxed. I don’t want to get into it all here, but the tech world is abuzz with Twitter’s recent changes that directly impact their app ecosystem (LinkedIn, for example, had to <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/twitter-vs-linkedin" target="_blank">end their Twitter sync option</a>).</p>
<p>It was, therefore, a matter of time before apps that had built their business model and service around Twitter would start to feel it. Based on my understanding, one of the changes is Twitter basing their API-request cap as a multiplier of the app’s current number of users, which is naturally pretty limiting to smaller startups.</p>
<p>This is saddening to see. Twimbow was a brilliant client, to the point where I can’t really stand Twitter’s own Web UI, or most of the other clients out there. Even since Twimbow ran into refresh/API-call limitations, my Twitter activity has dropped drastically since I no longer have Twitter open when I’m at my desk. I still use and enjoy <a href="http://stone.com/neue/" target="_blank">Twittelator Neue</a> on the phone, and that’s where most of my tweets come from these days but the future for apps isn’t encouraging.</p>
<p>All said and done, I hope Twitter knows it shouldn’t be killing the ecosystem altogether. Twitter has systematically bought out providers such as TweetDeck to capture a client in each platform/device category, but it <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/29582867630/twitters-api-changes" target="_blank">doesn’t look like they have the skill and/or capacity to maintain them all</a>. With their new restrictions though, apps will continue to die, and while I know that newer Twitter users just use their Web UI which has gotten more feature rich, it still doesn’t have the experience I’m used to or want and at some point, I fear I’ll tire of forcing myself to get on and look at my timeline.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s just me.</p>

<p>Hey, LinkedIn, why would I believe you this time?</p>
<p>I get a new invite every month, then a reminder that it’s the last day…then that I have it for another month. Plus after my experience with them overcharging me (severely) over an ads offer, I’m just not interested at this point.</p>
