        <h2><a href="/2015/11/08/some-thoughts-post.html">Some thoughts post the Bihar election results</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I’ll start with this, I’m a big fan of our PM Narendra Modi. I say this having tracked him lightly over the last (5) years, ie his Gujarat tenure, and more seriously over the last (2) years, leading to his ascendency to the PM’s chair last year to date.</p>
<p>Since then, lots of things have happened, some predictably so. Overall, the GoI has performed reasonably well. Sure, there are those who want the big bang reforms and headlines but many circles admit that there is a lot of cleanup that needs to be done on the ground. Slowly but surely, the economic indicators are moving in favor of India—<a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-ranks-130-in-ease-of-doing-business-report-jumps-12-spots-1237167" target="_blank">ease of business rankings</a>, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/12/03/india-ranked-less-corrupt-than-china-for-the-first-time-in-18-years/" target="_blank">improvements against corruption</a>, and maybe more generally, <a href="http://www.rediff.com/business/report/pix-special-most-valuable-nation-brands-india-ranks-at-7/20151012.htm" target="_blank">brand India</a>. Internally, schemes for the poor, <a href="http://www.pmjdy.gov.in/account-statistics-country.aspx" target="_blank">financial inclusion</a>, movements towards <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/why-uday-discom-restructuring-initiative-will-work-goyal_4015181.html" target="_blank">electrification of India</a>, and attempts towards <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/business/pm-modi-says-transforming-reform-is-a-marathon-not-a-sprint-wants-india-to-be-a-job-creator-2497506.html" target="_blank">developing the manpower of India as well</a>. Recently, even <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/once-a-month-pm-narendra-modi-steps-in-to-revive-stalled-projects-1238011" target="_blank">reports of Mr. Modi’s project management</a> — things I’ve heard many times in Gujarat—have been shared. This is how he works, and Mr. Modi will always be the man for long term implementation vision &amp; capabilities — something I have seen myself over the last 10 years in Gujarat.</p>
<p>But things are more center stage now for him. And a strong counter narrative to his efforts has been in the making since May last year. But let’s be honest, the <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/hook-line-and-sinker-modis-media-baiters-laid-a-trap-for-him-and-he-walked-into-it-2482626.html" target="_blank">GoI hasn’t entirely helped</a>, and a lot of the narrative problems are internal to the BJP (which sadly affects the GoI directly). Leaders like Shatrugan Sinha who <a href="https://twitter.com/ShatruganSinha/status/655612079840235521" target="_blank">openly give importance to comments</a> against the party, and <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjps-kailash-vijayvargiya-makes-friends-and-controversies-easily-1240154" target="_blank">various other sideliners</a> who loudmouth (and sometimes get sucked into) ridiculous comments clearly does not go down well in the electorate. It is unfortunate that every single BJP comment is highlighted to the skies, while ridiculous comments made otherwise are sidelined quickly. Let’s not even get into the <a href="http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-is-the-supreme-court-angry-with-sanjiv-bhatt/" target="_blank">Sanjive Bhatt episode</a> that barely saw the light of day, and was mostly kept to online versions.</p>
<p>The counter-Modi narrative worked in Delhi, and we now know it has worked in Bihar. Everything from AwardWapsi, Dadri and Kalburgi has stuck. The technicality clearly doesn’t matter; whether the GoI is directly responsible or not can be argued till the sun goes down but it doesn’t matter. The perception is clearly sticking and working against the narrative Mr. Modi (and the BJP) has painstakingly built leading to May 2014. The Congress in particular has been smart, and have carefully used non-Congress voices knowing that the electorate was less likely to hear them out based on their voting history as well.</p>
<p>There is also growing resentment around the fact that the justice timeframe in India is far too slow. No doubt, the GoI continues to take steps to solve that problem, but the fact that numerous accused are roaming free—take the case of Lalu Yadav who has won the election in Bihar while out on bail, and he’s convicted—reflects badly on the GoI and for the future of India as a whole. <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bikaner-land-grab-case-enforcement-directorate-searches-premises-of-delhi-firm-1239415" target="_blank">Even when some effort is being made</a>, it is largely swept under the carpet.</p>
<p>I can’t say that I know Mr. Modi well; I actually don’t at all. But I can somewhat say that I know his ability to work and succeed beyond what the rhetoric may say about him. This defeat too shall pass. The opposition will do better than to underestimate him as a person, and his political will. He will continue to have my support &amp; <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/09/17/1-the-modi-phenomenon/" target="_blank">the support of the country</a>. But it is now time to evaluate some of the strategy, the media, the loudmouths and forces that hamper the future of our country, and his own office. And the message has to be equally cumulative.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2015/09/30/the-ipad-pro.html">The iPad Pro and why it’s for me</a></h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There seem to be two central questions around the recently announced (but long rumored) <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a>: Why, and who is it for?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ipad/ipad-pro-review-3580947/" target="_blank">Macworld UK</a>’s review mentioned even the name seemed off; I think however resemblance to other tablets is more coincidental. Apple is bringing consistency in its PC and tablet line-up: the Airs for regular users, the Pros for the ones that need more computing power.</p>
<p>But this parallel goes much beyond the name. We are at a post of close convergence between Apple’s laptop and tablet lineup.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>The new iPhone 6S beats the new MacBook in single-core performance on Geekbench</em>, and is within spitting distance in multi-core. That’s astounding. I can’t wait to see the scores for the iPad Pro later this year. — John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/09/the_iphones_6s" target="_blank">the iPhones 6s</a>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the right question in deciding whether you prefer the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" target="_blank">Macbook</a> or the iPad therefore, is the one posted a few days ago (really sorry I seem to have lost the link): Do you want to touch your screen or not?</p>
<p>I believe there are <a href="https://500ish.com/crossing-the-ipad-rubicon-51bbdb52bf48" target="_blank">enough people like me</a> who would love to give up their laptops for the ‘freedom’ of the iPad, not that interested in keeping two major devices in our lives in addition to the iPhone. What I’ve realized though is that since getting the iPhone 6 last year, I find I have transferred a lot of processing to it already — primarily when I’m working through my inbox — without the hassle of pulling out my Macbook each time. I found this particularly true when I traveled.</p>
<p>Rewind about 8 months ago, and I tried using an iPad as my primary device to see if it really did fit into my life. I ran into two major problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The screen wasn’t large enough to use without an external monitor (for work). It may be a non-retina Macbook, the 13" works really well.</li>
<li>Working through email while browsing for some information, reviewing code while testing — these were doable, but tedious. Double tap, click app, double tap, you get the drift. More so when you didn’t hit the gesture right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of my primary issues are seemingly addressed by the iPad Pro, with the 12.9" screen that’s twice the resolution I use today and side-by-side views in iOS 9. But there’s more. 95% of my life is within the browser — social life, work web applications and other time beyond just browsing. The same are apps on my iPhone and quite a few of them — Twitter, Facebook, accounting apps — offer a better experience compared to the browser, and the iPad Pro stands to gain again due to its screen size.</p>
<p>I have been considering (and re-considering) upgrading to the new Macbook towards the end of the year. The iPad Pro announcement has made me compare them. They’re both approximately the same screen size (12.9" vs the 12") and weight so it becomes a question of whether I want OS X or iOS to be my primary operating system.</p>

<p>I think the iPad can suffice as the primary device and this has been the case since perhaps the iPad 4 or the iPad Air where browsing, email and social media were the primary tasks, such as been the case for my parents, who ditched their PC two years ago. I think with the iPad Pro, we will see the next exodus from the laptop era, with the device definitely targeting a niche — computing power with the freedom of iOS.</p>
<p>Developers will no doubt start to review their apps, and build new ones to further move traditional PC-only tasks to apps, similar to the AutoCAD 360 example. Apple is betting on that.</p>
<p>And I want in.</p>

        <p>Life is no longer just a yes or a no. Almost always, the answer is ‘it depends.’</p>
<p>What I do for a living involves technological babble, nerd speak. But it still doesn’t mean I know everything about your situation to provide you a consult. That’s why more often that not it’s ‘it depends’. This is the right approach for your IT environment provided a, b &amp; c. Based on x, y &amp; z, you should do this. It depends.</p>
<p>The same happens with food. Two different people asking me for a recommendation for a place to eat out will be often given two different responses, even if the cuisine is the same. Some people relate to my experience better; others prefer things that are different from me. Again, it depends.</p>
<p>We live in a world of many, many choices. Technology, politics, food, life.</p>
<p>To the world at large: stop expecting finite answers, and stop outraging over opposing answers. What works for you, won’t always work for everyone else, and vice-versa. It’s okay. Really, it is. Take a deep breath. It will be okay.</p>

<strong>The Nutcracker, Mumbai: 4 </strong>/ 5<br />Cuisine: Casual, Cafe (All vegetarian, they serve eggs)</blockquote>
<p>It’s hot and humid. You’re trekking down an alleyway, following the advice of a must-visit place where ‘everything on the menu is delicious’. And you’re dying for a salad after a week long gluttony that comes with travel.</p>
<p>As you perspire your way to the door, you’re greeted with a quaint, bustling, cozy little cafe that has extra stools hanging upside down on the walls. Interesting.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>The Nutcracker </em>itself, a table seems almost hard to find at lunchtime, and there’s little room to wait. Thankfully this phase of our journey only lasts about 10 minutes and we’re ushered to a table. As the waiter eventually comes up to us, I order the Asian salad and I put forth my eternal drink question: “Is your iced tea made in-house?” With the answer in the affirmative, we can proceed.</p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Homemade Iced tea, Potato Wedges &amp; Chargrilled Veg Salad</figcaption></figure>
<p>We feel like our order is too healthy, so a side of potato wedges are quickly added. These crispy bits of heaven remind me of <a href="https://youtu.be/F-VsLRVemzk?t=2m13s" target="_blank">Heston Blumenthal’s triple cooked chips</a>, such is their perfection. And yet I’m blown away most by a condiment—the fresh wholegrain mustard. Such is Nutcracker’s attention to detail that even this — this delicious, lick it off your fingers mustard — is stellar.</p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Asian Salad w/ grilled tofu</figcaption></figure>
<p>The refreshing Iced tea and the delicious Asian Salad makes my lunch absolutely worth it. The tofu grilled vegetable salad is equally good, but the tanginess and zing of the Asian salad makes it our favorite of the meal, at par with 5-star versions of this dish.</p>
<p>As we slowly cool down and settle, it’s time to leave. But not before the 3 people almost breathing down our necks have started where our experience began, ready to take over our table.</p>
<p>I hear the burgers are pretty good too.</p>

<p><em>Note: I was invited to a complimentary meal at fournil de Pierre, with no obligation for a review.</em></p>
<p>My absolute first thought on entering <em>fournil de PIERRE</em> last week, inhaling the aroma of a combination of freshly baked bread and freshly ground pepper (oh my) was that my <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/45821755870/nanaji" target="_blank">grandfather</a>, an avid bread fan — his last trip to Dubai was spent eating LPQ bread for breakfast every day — would have absolutely loved the place!</p>
<p>Indeed, the place seems to have it just right. Its ambience, fragrance and decor transported us away from the Dubai hustle and bustle to a place where fresh bread, delicious soups and pastries can be had multiple times a day without any effect to your waistline. The influence was completed by French music playing away above us, and an extremely smiling wait staff. I think I’d have melted if they spoke to me with a French accent, but alas, that wasn’t to happen.</p>
<figure>

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/052e9-0a3uuuvvqks_77fkh.jpg" />
</figure>
<p>The menu is diverse, covering soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, pastries, you know the drill. I can confirm that the French Onion soup is the best I’ve ever had, served in a lovely crusty bread and I absolutely need to go back for a sandwich that had some combination of organic bread, green apples and goat cheese.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I was also pleasantly surprised by a mocktail — peach puree, pineapple and…spinach. I only agreed to try it out of utter curiosity — a spinach and peach drink? — and I learnt that it was not just possible but that spinach, when added subtly can enhance a peach puree brilliantly. We concluded that the chef clearly knows his combinations. Worth a try.</p>
<p>A visit to a patisserie cannot be complete without dessert. The chef’s recommended strawberry cheesecake was extremely fresh, and different compared to the usual American cheesecake varieties I’m used to. And the little star was the White Forest, baked with a hint of pineapple.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a lovely getaway, and thankfully not inside a mall. I’m not sure how they’d handle being packed to the brim, but if it was anything like the other night, you can safely bet I’ll be in that crowd.</p>
<p>Check ‘em out, mes ami(e)s. You won’t be disappointed.</p>
<p><em>*Yes, I know it’s spelt Paris, but I spelt it out phonetically for better effect. It sounds even better if you add a few more e’s to the end. Try it. Really.</em></p>

<p>Who wasn’t excited to hear about the Cheesecake Factory’s opening in the Dubai Mall in August? I was — having loved their menu during my last visit to the US, not to mention all the Big Bang Theory love — but when I learnt of the long wait times, decided I should let some time pass before trying it out.</p>
<p>Not that it mattered. We ventured down to celebrate a birthday, and, lo and behold, the lines had not died down at all. “1.5 hours” said the polite hostess as she handed us a little buzzer that would let us know when our table was ready. Yup, that’s how organized their wait cycle is.</p>
<p>And how long their lines still are.</p>
<p>(Btw, that’s the waiting line to get on the waiting list for a table.)</p>
<p>We opened with the lettuce wraps, something I had tried and loved <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">during my US visit</a>, and was curious to see how that translated over.</p>
<p>‘Rather well’ is the answer. The produce was fresh, the sauces delicious as always and the appetizer gained a thumbs up around the table.</p>
<p>What is a bummer though: they’re not selling their dressings &amp; sauces like <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">they do in the US</a>. Bummer, bummer.</p>
<p>I have to talk about the ‘eggplant burger’ — it’s not exactly called that on the menu — but it is, by far, the best rendition of a grilled eggplant anything I’ve had at a meal. Wrapped in a burger bun, topped with fresh melted cheese &amp; grilled onions and cooked to absolute perfection.</p>
<p>The waiter might have been confused what the sandwich looked like (we were told it was a flatbread sandwich rather than a burger), but the chef most certainly was not. You may be a meat eater or an eggplant hater, but you’re going to have a hard time saying no to this. Ya hear me, Poston?</p>
<p>I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to classify the Factory into a specific cuisine, but at least they do them all well. With over 200 items on the menu, deciding what to eat was hard.</p>
<p>We figured quesedillas were as different as the food was going to get, and these deserve a mention for being served with the freshest guacamole (yes, just about everything we had that afternoon had some avocado in it, but no regrets), delicious salsa and rich sour cream. The quesedillas were kept simple, just the way I like them.</p>
<p>No celebration is complete without a slice of cheesecake — well, no visit to the Factory is complete without one either — and, <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">just like in the US</a>, their staff obliged with a little deco to make the slice look as festive as possible.</p>
<p>What’s interesting overall about my experience is the consistency. Even the look and feel of the decorated plate matched its US counterpart. Don’t believe me? <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">Take a look for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>The food was delicious, fresh and something you’d definitely want to go back for. The place is buzzing with activity, and if you can get around the incredible wait times — to be fair, it can’t be that hard to kill time in the Dubai Mall right? — you’re in for a treat.</p>

<p>Gorgeous track.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" target="_blank">Apple’s Macbook reveal</a> uses this as its background score, which might seem like an obvious choice considering they went gold. But what’s even better is the artist represents the song with three models in the video, against the three available with this Macbook’s release — silver, space gray and gold. Talk about attention to detail.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Netflix and HBO are slowly but surely changing a lot about the way we consume TV. <a href="https://medium.com/@rexsorgatz" title="Go to the profile of Rex Sorgatz" target="_blank">Rex Sorgatz</a> actually makes an interesting point in <a href="https://medium.com/message/how-netflix-broke-the-unbreakable-spoiler-alert-f0215bf930cf" target="_blank">How Netflix the spoiler alert and how to fix it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In attempting to fix an outdated system (the weekly release calendar), technology has created a new problem (silencing discussion). But surely, we can solve this dilemma.</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the premise, and the fact that binge watching has changed the way we talk about TV. Rex’s proposal is a modest mid-way between what it was, and what it is becoming, but I don’t believe it works for ‘all’ TV.</p>
<p>However, this made me think about something else.</p>
<p>As someone who lives in a country where ‘Sorry, but this content is not available in your geographical location’ is a constant let down, I think content providers will do better to fix <em>this</em> problem. The movie industry seems to be able to put out movies around the globe, and people are willing to pay multiple times a month, to watch them. It probably helps that there aren’t content providers sitting in between.</p>
<p>The world is too ubiquitous today for this to still be a problem. Particularly for things like TV previews, and interviews with stars. Finding a consistent way to deliver TV content across the globe, inside a simple subscription model, is where the disruption probably is.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2015/03/11/the-sheer-execution.html">The sheer execution of Apple, Inc.</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>As is probably the case with many of us, the last few days have been mired by thoughts around the Apple events. At first I intended to post a few thoughts on the  Watch, then the Macbook, then maybe the event as a whole as <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/52694042971/cant-innovate-my-ass" target="_blank">I tend to do sometimes</a>. But invariably, my thoughts started to focus on Apple as a company.</p>
<p>I clearly have a lot to learn from Tim Cook. Apple is beyond a well-oiled machine now. I’m not saying it’s not without its issues. But, somehow, they seem to be on course to pivot once again without much trouble, significantly faster than the competition. While it is interesting that the pundits have already written both the MacBook and the Watch off, saying the price points, particularly for the limited edition gold watch, is “ridiculous”, I think it’s a usual case of not comparing Apples to, well, apples. Just like Apple’s entry into music, smartphones and tablets, affected those <em>respective</em> industries, the  Watch isn’t Apple’s venture into another subcategory of the tech industry, but into fashion, and the watch industry. Expect the price of the sport edition to drop slightly by the second or third iteration; just like I expect the price of the new MacBook to align with the current pricing of the MacBook Air in two years’ time.</p>
<p>But I digress. What is getting to be more and more impressive to someone who looks at businesses and operations, is how clinical Apple is in their execution today. Yes, Apple has a fantastic cash reserve, can attract the best talent, yada yada, but Apple continues to focus and streamline its operations down to the point that people expect a new phone, tablet and laptop, a new version of OS X, iOS released <em>every</em> year. Incremental updates are just not good enough. And I’m forced to wonder, good enough for what, for whom? Microsoft is still <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/09/frequency-and-predictability-of-builds-for-windows-insiders/" target="_blank">only able to promise regular updates to Windows</a> — let alone play catch up on smartphones and tablets, forget thinking about entering the wearable industry; Google just barely gets out an Android update each year which is just about compatible with its own devices. When was the last time Google innovated to the likes of Android or Gmail? And this is from the company that insisted its employees dedicate 20% of their week towards innovation at some point in their history.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the midst of all of this by the way, Apple managed to convert its entire phone architecture to x64 without anyone knowing, rumors of a 12" MacBook Air may have been floating, but no one quite knew the extent to which the device would be developed, and pivoted itself to challenge the fashion industry while the rest are still trying to figure out the best way to execute a ‘wearable’. In the process, they got the industry to follow them into x64, will lead the adoption of USB-C and will cause the competition to build higher priced smartwatches.</p>
<p>And yet, people will continue to create clickbait headlines about Apple’s failures.</p>
