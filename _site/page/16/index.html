        <p>As news of Steve Jobs’ resignation flutters through the cyberspace, most people pronouncing this the end of an era. It is. Steve Jobs may not have had the agreement of every John and Jane Doe, but we definitely had the respect of a man who knew what he was doing, often way ahead of his peers.</p>
<p>What struck me is that this was a matter of time — not his first medical leave for one — and yet it comes with a level of shock and surprise, going to show how larger than life the man is.</p>
<p>A tribute to the man who envisioned a new era to computing, and pretty much got us there.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Famous words from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryst_with_destiny" target="_blank">inspiring speech</a>. India celebrates another year of independence, and there’s a lot on my mind.</p>
<p>Every year on this day, I introspect a little. What does this day really mean to me? The answer is weird. It means a lot — and yet, it somehow means so little. I feel patriotic, I feel inspired, I love the tri-colors fluttering everywhere, I’ve attended the flag hoisted ceremonies organized as far out as Philadelphia. Yet I come up with an empty feeling when I think about what I have done. For my country. At all.</p>
<p>The thoughts take me broader, farther. I think of the world. Of the crises and of <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/08/london_riots.html" target="_blank">the mess</a>. And I re-call <a href="http://www.farscape.com/" target="_blank">my favorite TV show</a> of all time, one that — as it drew to a close — highlighted what it means to be human, not Indian or American or Middle-eastern, or anything else for that matter. What we can achieve as a species, and what <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/08/london_riots.html" target="_blank">we are destroying</a>. Of political power, and corruption, racism and hatred and cold war.</p>
<p>Is this what we are really about? If so, I genuinely don’t feel like being human on those occasions.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I think I want to focus on what needs to change, rather than what cannot be touched or controlled.</p>
<p>Over the last year, maybe a couple years, I started to find my call, and interestingly, it lies in technology (and <a href="http://www.naihar.com" target="_blank">food</a>, but that’ll kill my point right now). Over the last few years, I’ve <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/web-apps-the-here-and-now-0" target="_blank">witnessed</a>, thought about and <a href="http://blog.cognitoit.com/saas-and-the-symbiosis-between-it-business" target="_blank">complained</a> about changes in technology, the impact it’s having on our day-to-day lives. I have <a href="http://blog.cognitoit.com/saas-and-the-symbiosis-between-it-business" target="_blank">some clear thoughts</a> on what I think technology should be doing, which inturn defines what it shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>
<p>A lot has changed since the advent of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> was around way longer, but it was always a closed network — something to help you create a close-by community, or keep in touch with your friends and family. Twitter opened it all up — by giving us access to people we’d never be “friends” with in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> paradigm but could still interact with without losing the feeling of privacy and control. It became a news feed, a community builder and a conversation starter all in one. In India, this has grown over the last couple of years. Today news channels regularly display opinions collected via <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/timesofindia" target="_blank">twitter</a> (and even <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TimesofIndia" target="_blank">facebook</a>). It is starting to bring people together, giving them a voice and channelize support (or opposition).</p>
<p>I think this will slowly but surely impact governance in India. Sadly, our political system is 64 years old (and not in the good way) and well, rubbish. In India, there is a large group of people who think the political system is pointless to bother with. But there’s a young upcoming group of this generation who is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/India-Against-Corruption-Dubai-Solidarity-Forum/194856737219541" target="_blank">going out there</a> to make their point too. It may take a few years, but social media is going to help improve it, and with it, things will change.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>The broader technology scope is equally interesting. I frankly hate a lot about the status quo, and more importantly, the attitude people have towards technology — especially in the corporate area. I’ve been looked down upon, called an idiot and laughed at purely because one look at me makes people know I’m an Indian IT guy, and then I must be like <a href="http://search.dilbert.com/search?p=R&amp;srid=S3%2d4&amp;lbc=dilbert&amp;w=Outsource&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fdilbert%2ecom%2fstrips%2fcomic%2f2010%2d02%2d12%2f&amp;rk=1&amp;uid=423127987&amp;sid=2&amp;ts=custom&amp;rsc=33QnUk4JSgg1gJLa&amp;method=and&amp;isort=date&amp;view=list&amp;filter=type%3acomic" target="_blank">every Indian IT guy</a>. It’s a funny kind of racism.</p>
<p>I’ve even been told that people are moving away from working with Indians because the cost-reduction does not offset the time and energy required to get Indians up to speed and up to the right level of professional working since we are “so far behind”. Is this what and where we want to be?</p>
<p>It is time to change that.</p>
<p>It’s our own damned fault too, and it needs to change with us first. Indians in technology need to stop coming off as bookworms, because we can be so much more. We need to stop rejecting new technologies and fighting over <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/technology/will-india-ban-the-blackberry-43817" target="_blank">stupid bans</a>, and focus on what we can do to improve the way we do things. Starting with education. And not stopping there. In some arenas, technology is so backward it’s not even laughable. I’ve even had <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/reliance-part-iii-and-im-done" target="_blank">bad experiences even with the big names</a> and the way they treat us, their customers, fellow Indians.</p>
<p>This is an open call to any organization in India who wants to change they way they do things, and the way they use technology, and need advice. Heck, I’ll even do as much as I can of it for free. All I ask is you have an open mind to embrace what I have to say and accept that there needs to be a change in attitude. If you don’t like what I have to say after that, no problem. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chiragnd" target="_blank">Tweet</a>, drop me a line on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/chiragnd" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://gplus.to/chiragnd" target="_blank">Google+</a>, whatever.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.cognitoit.com/news/cognito-announces-launch-of-cloud-based-web--email-security-in-india-1570283.html" target="_blank">started it</a> a little bit too. And while it hasn’t been easy, I will keep trying until technology peers in India — the local, day-to-day folks just as much as the big guns — change their attitude towards technology, operations and most importantly — the way they treat their users, customers and us in general.</p>
<p>It’s an odd goal, I know, but this is how I can contribute.</p>
<p>How will you?</p>

        <p>It continually amazes me to see the kind of creativity that comes out of American movies and TV. As I finally watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/" target="_blank">Sucker Punch</a> this week, this was more evident than ever.<br /><br />There is so much creativity in the telling of this story. When I compare that against the real run of the mill rubbish we see in bollywood or on Indian tv…I quite literally, have no words.</p>
<p>I think that, in the Bollywood paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>a movie like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/" target="_blank">Sucker Punch</a> wouldn’t have been conceptualized</li>
<li>if we assume for a second that it could have been, no one would have been ready to fund it</li>
<li>if it had been funded, not one ‘mainstream’ish actor would have found the script worthy enough (and)</li>
<li>if one had, they probably couldn’t actually have pulled it off</li>
<li>very few people would have gone to watch it</li>
<li>some politician would have opposed the way young girls were portrayed, and possibly, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCwQqQIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fentertainment%2Fbollywood%2Fnews-interviews%2FPending-preview-Punjab-bans-Aarakshan%2Farticleshow%2F9564070.cms&amp;ei=J3tFToHREI_PsgaP5civBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm2sYtX8W0k0nhIjrhg-8M9-iQmw" target="_blank">banned it</a>
</li>
<li>All in all, it would have been a big enough mess to deter anyone from even voicing the idea</li>
</ul>
<p>On 100% of current Indian television, we still haven’t gotten past the ‘oh-my-god my mother-in-law is insane’ storyline.</p>
<p>It’s sad really.</p>

<p>Anyone who’s driven around Abu Dhabi a bit will notice Il Forno outlets spread around the city. Boasting authentic food, the real reason I wanted to try it out was because someone who tried out my <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13" target="_blank">favorite pizzeria in Dubai</a> (which has since shut down) said he had liked Il Forno better.</p>
<p>Not one to take criticism poorly, I tried it.</p>
<p>One bite in and Il Forno fell into the category of just another pizza place. They’re not bad, but they’re not great either. I only tried their pizza — I went with their garlic-and-olive-oil option — and felt mostly like I was eating a couple-hours-old manakish. The crust was overwhelming, didn’t feel too fresh and the cheese was your usual unfrozen mozzarella. The iced tea I had with the pizza was your standard run-of-the-mill restaurant iced tea and not brewed or such either.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc03681_1" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/b76eb96cb4.jpg" /></figure>
<p>Il Forno works with something that does look like a woodfire oven, although it’s a pretty standard one in reality. The staff were friendly though and while I’ve only tried their pizzas on a couple different occasions, it’s been with the same results.</p>
<p>For those following closely, the search continues for good pizza in the UAE. There are some <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-mamma-rossella" target="_blank">I like</a>, some I don’t and others I despise (and therefore, haven’t really visited since the start of this blog). But I’ve received some <a href="http://foodiva.net/2011/07/dubais-best-pizza-emporio-armani-caffe/" target="_blank">good suggestions</a> and will post up once I get a chance to try them out. All in all, Il Forno is not going to be my favorite pizza anytime soon.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I received a DM over twitter that went: “Is this you: <a href="http://t.co/GAVYjLo" target="_blank">http://t.co/GAVYjLo</a>?"</p>
<p>Oh relax, it wasn’t spam — well that was when twitter wasn’t so infected anyway. Point is, it was linked to a foodblog (go ahead, click it), but the friend had confused it as being this blog because of “eerily similar[ity] to u!” Another food blog? With much better pictures? Ooh. I <a href="http://www.foodonymph.com/spicy-venue-set-my-tongue-ablaze-and-i-still-crawled-back-to-beg-for-more/" target="_blank">hastily posted</a> what I can only imagine now was a <a href="http://www.foodonymph.com/spicy-venue-set-my-tongue-ablaze-and-i-still-crawled-back-to-beg-for-more/" target="_blank">creepy comment</a> and didn’t think anything of it afterward. Who responds to blog comments right? A grand total of 4 minutes later, I received an email titled “Hi — just saw your comment on my blog :)”.</p>
<p>Today, Famished in Arabia (or FiA) as we were coined, is a group of 56 food bloggers (as of 8 p.m. GMT+4 today) covering various walks of life and blogging about a whole variety of different things — from expert restaurant reviews, expert bakers, expert pickle-makers, expert restaurant owners and.. well there’s me too. The group has seen a phenomenal growth — oh a history buff you say? you want <a href="http://www.foodonymph.com/uae-food-bloggers/" target="_blank">ALL the details</a>? — anyway, the rest of you, like I was saying…</p>
<p>Today Famished in Arabia celebrates a year of existance. And what a marvelous one at that. Some very creative people, some very talented people and most importantly some very passionate people. This means that as the site grows, the information flowing gets even better — new places worth checking out, suggestions on evening-outings, and even tips on cooking and baking better. Even more, how to photograph food — some of the <a href="http://www.naihar.com/modak" target="_blank">improvements</a> (What rubbish you say? You haven’t seen any? Pfft, <a href="http://www.naihar.com/thepla" target="_blank">go away</a>!) you see on this blog over the past year have happened because of things I’ve picked up by just admiring all of these blogs.</p>
<p>Right, so what’s the point of the post you ask? Well it’s to say Happy Birthday FiA. It’s to be happy and proud to see it grow into something great — just think about it, for a country like UAE, to have 56 independent food bloggers each with their own unique voice. That’s amazing. And you know what? I’m actually sure there are more out there, waiting until the silent assassins..er…acquirers at FiA pounce and draw them in with cupcakes…</p>
<p>I leave you with the <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F17537357499653494349%2Fbundle%2FFood%20Bloggers%20UAE" target="_blank">RSS feed aggregate</a> of the food bloggers, and if you’re on twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chiragnd/famished-in-arabia" target="_blank">the FiA list</a>. Go nuts! Just don’t <a href="http://www.naihar.com/devils-food-cake-topped-with-chocolate-ganach" target="_blank">forget the chocolate</a>.</p>

        <p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>I had to really think about this one. I finally decided to file it under #funny.</p>
<blockquote>Bachelors have been barred from entering a newly- inaugurated shopping centre in Dubai for fear that they would misuse the massive discounts on offer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We found out that many of them were buying our products on offer only to resell them in at their stores at the original price. So we have decided to turn away single men from entering the hypermarket until the promotion ends,” he said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Only men accompanied by a woman are being allowed into the store.</blockquote>
<p>Because that totally solves the problem.</p>

        <blockquote>“At some point I took it personally. #fail”</blockquote>
<p>I remember this tweet someone wrote before going offline for a few months very vividly. I’m not entirely sure why, but it just stuck. Maybe because it resonated with me somehow. Maybe..I’m not sure.</p>
<p>I saw this coming I think. It’s not often that I lose my temper, in fact, it happens rarely enough that I cannot recall the last time I did it. But over the last month or so, I was brimming. I could feel it happening with every conversation — and it wasn’t just one person. Today, I lost it altogether. I’m not happy about that. It may not have been a disaster, but it still was not good.</p>
<p>So today, we start again. A little rehash, a little time-alone, a little bit of introspection. The outcome, as before, will be the same: return to the patient side of me, the one that dominates without chaos, and the one who’s shoulder people like to cry on because it is offered without judgement; one that would never expect a shoulder in return.</p>
<p>It is time.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t love candy. Come to think of it, I can’t think of anyone who’s ever told me they hate Gummies. Maybe not biggest fans, but don’t like Gummies. Yea, NEVER happens. Gummies are things that you can’t stop eating once you start, then you feel sick and tell yourself, okay not having *that* many again. Until a couple of days later, you walk by a store that sells gummies and…pfft, what’s another entire pack going to do — I survived fine last time!</p>
<p>I indulged heavily in gummies — gummy bears &amp; worms in particular during my stay in Philadelphia. With everything from the next block grocery store to the elaborate candy stores carry them, they were never in short supply. Over time, you even new which ones carried fresh gummies (yes, there is such a thing as ‘fresh’ gummies compared to stale ones. It matters!).</p>
<p>Moving back to Dubai meant a literal cut down in the amount of gummy intake. That probably wasn’t a bad thing but you also don’t find gummies around the block, and when you do, they just seem expensive. Ofcourse, all has changed over time and I can safely say I can find gummies within a 10 minute radius from whereever I am these days.</p>
<p>This however, brings me to <a href="http://www.wrigley.com/global/brands/life-savers.aspx" target="_blank">Lifesavers</a>. For the uninitiated, Lifesavers can be best described as the American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_%28sweet%29" target="_blank">Polo</a>. Well, you don’t actually get Polo there, and you see Lifesavers everywhere. Frankly they don’t really come close on a taste front, but they make do. What Polo however doesn’t have, are…Lifesavers gummies! Those brilliant, mint-candy-with-a-hole-shaped soft gummies. So good. Case in point: when I touched down in the US last year for the first time in 4 years, the only thing I wanted oh-so-badly along with my Snapple Iced Tea obsession were, yup, the Lifesavers Gummies. And yes, they are joined by the 7–11 Big Gulp.</p>

<p>The good news is, the ENOC petrol station store has started featuring Lifesavers, including the big versions, but in hard candy. Everytime I stop by to fill up the tank — even if more than once a day at the same station — I make a quick move into the store purely to check out the Lifesavers aisle in the sad-puppy-dog-eye hope. So far, I’ve been disappointed.</p>
<p>Lifesavers, are you listening?</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/07/22/first-impressions-lion.html">First Impressions: Lion (OS X 10.7)</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/01412-0vuzimzxkmoh5s-yw.png" /></figure>
<p>My early thoughts on the all-new Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion — image via <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>), in trademarked bullet-point style:</p>
<ul>
<li>I upgraded to a new OS for all of $30 and did not step out of my room. While this appeals to my height of laziness, you have to say that is an impressive way to function. The installation took about 35 minutes in total, not counting download time (a little over an hour).</li>
<li>(Update) Case in point, it just took me &gt;30 minutes to download the 30MB new VLC.</li>
<li>I decided to leave the new scrolling as is and test it for a while first. In a couple of hours, the new scrolling is happening a lot more intuitively. I definitely like how full screen apps are being handled — pretty much a separate virtual desktop that you can scroll in and out of easily.</li>
<li>I’m having am amazing time using <a href="http://www.twimbow.com/" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> — or I’d imagine any twitter-like application — scrolling through twitter columns is now identical to using an iPhone.</li>
<li>Mission Control is a brilliant add-on. Actually it’s not so much mission control itself, but the way this has been integrated with the new scrolling and the virtual desktops mode. Very seamless, intuitive to move around and it does what you think it would do. I also like that Dashboard has now setup its own screen on the far left (similar to the search screen on the iOS). It handles dual desktop better than before.</li>
<li>What remains to be seen is how seamless the change will be between using a Magic Mouse and using the trackpad. At my desk I use an external keyboard and mouse, whereas often during the day or when out, I’m glistening about the trackpad. Now the gestures are a bit different between them for some of the tasks, so it might take more than one try to get it right based on the input device.</li>
<li>I’m not so sure about the Mail app yet. I’m a active <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank">Gmail</a> user for both personal and work, part of the reason is that they offer a significantly improved interface and controls, and the other part is my not having to manage my inbox and archive and so on and so forth — a major pain in Outlook days. Apple seems to have got the interface down real well, I’ll give them that, but I’m not as fast on it as I’d be on <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank">Gmail</a>, simply with the shortcuts — I use keyboard almost entirely to sort, shift, search, archive, delete and send email in <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank">Gmail</a>. Tab+Space vs Command-Shift-D? Yeaaa, no. That said, the interface is smooth, clean and the use in full screen mode can be very productive and focused. For now I’ll use it on and off, but the lack of labels and keyboard ease of use will deter me as a full-time Mail user. However, I can completely see why normal users (ie, non-heavy-gmail, outlook or previous Mail users) would be very happy with it.</li>
<li>So far, I’ve not run into an app compatabilities. However, apps that would improve upon the finder, such as say <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>which adds menu options have lost these, so a re-install will be necessary. At the same time, a variety of my pre-Lion preferences (such as changing my screenshot folder) have stayed on.</li>
<li>The all new account syncing is actually quite good, although surprising. Using my stored account info the keychain, it managed to figure out that I used 3 chat accounts that also had calendar, contacts and email attached to it, imported the accounts and gave me a prompt to chose what I wanted synchronized. Nifty.</li>
<li>I also get a feeling that the Dock is on its way out. I was barely using it anyway — a combination of <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a> and Spotlight pretty much give me everything I’d want — but with Launchpad coming on as a visual ‘Let me see all my apps’ option…</li>
<li>Finder, and just general interface wise, it’s looking a bit more polished. The buttons looks almost Chrome-HTML5 like and snazzier, and there are definitely some adjustments to contrast, shading and general whiteness.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s still early days. Still, 1 million downloads on Day 1 is pretty staggering (think $30m revenue and no shipping/box costs). I haven’t tried everything yet, particularly Resume &amp; Versioning.</p>
<p>Overall, I think I now understand <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>’s Back to the Mac campaign a lot better. They have learnt some sharp lessons from the iOS adoption and incorporated them with good insight into the OS. Launchpad, Scrolling and Full Screen apps are great additions to both experience and productivity — and mission control seems to be a much-upgraded version of Spaces+Dashboard without losing their usefulness. I’m happy so far.</p>
<p>Be happy to hear your thoughts too!</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/07/14/it-all-ends.html">It all ends.</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Well for the two loyal readers this blog actually has, they’ll know <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/as-the-posters-say-it-all-ends" target="_blank">I got in to the premiere viewing</a> of the final installment of the Harry Potter series. I’ve been a huge fan of the books since I first read them in 2001 and frankly most of the movies tended to disappoint. But that’s normal with adaptations — you lose out on the subtleties, additional plotlines and in the case of Harry Potter, I feel we lost the inherent sarcasm that he spews oh so easily in the books.</p>
<p>That said, my overall verdict for the final installment is: satisfied.</p>
<p>As expected, there were a few changes, but I was definitely happy to see a lot of dialogue was imported straight off the books and the intensity was just as captivating. I’m not much of a review writer, but I am very much of a bullet-pointer and therefore, I give you — the bullet-pointed review. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li>I was constantly amused that wand translated to ‘baguette’ in the French subtitles.</li>
<li>Knowing that Flitwick and Griphook are played by the same person enforced on me that they looked like brothers. TO be fair, he carried out the role real well.</li>
<li>Bellatrix. Gosh. She does such a good job really, does Helena Carter. Even as Hermoine she’s rather convincing. The character is one of those love to hate</li>
<li>McGonagal was brilliant. I’m really glad they included the Locomotor spell, with a nice little quip. I wasn’t thrilled they left out her threat to Slughorn to have Slytherin choose an allegiance. The line “we duel to kill” in the book always gave me goosebumps.</li>
<li>Aberforth was awesome. Loved his character and it was unfortunate he had limited screen time but he had the tone and attitude correct, unlike Gambon’s Albus has been.</li>
<li>“The boy who lived, come to die.” Brilliant. That entire sequence was perfect.</li>
<li>Seconds after I thought to myself, where in Merlin’s Beard is Hagrid, he showed up on screen.</li>
<li>The Battle of Hogwarts lives up to expectation. The scenes, intensity, darkness and the fact that we got to see (again) a lot of the characters in small roles was great. I did miss John Cleese though.</li>
<li>Caveat (and a little bit of a spoiler). I’ve spoken to a couple who felt that they handled it well but I was not entirely thrilled with the last 15–20 minutes. It wasn’t bad, I just felt it could have been better, although I will say that outside of that, the movie surpassed my expectations. However, for me the end scenes were about the conversations Harry and Voldemort have. I missed that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I leave you with some thoughts from people sitting around me before the start of the premiere:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I cried at the end of the book wonder what’s going to happen in this movie!”</li>
<li>And my favorite: “If I haven’t seen part 1 is that okay?”</li>
</ul>

<p>When you look up Gujarati food, thepla ranks right up there. Theplas are pretty much one of those all-purpose items. A staple for any travelling Gujarati, it can be eaten plain, with condiments such as <a href="http://pickleindmiddle.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">indian pickles (achaar</a>), yogurt, garlic paste (one of my favorites) or with curries much like a roti. In fact, the best description of a thepla is probably a flavored roti — you find them in the plain/masala type, the methi (fenugreek), or kothmir (coriander) flavored types. With or without garlic. Adjusted to be soft and foldable or crisp and a little less foldable. Really thin, or slightly thicker. Every family has their own style and the actual recipe is ultimately pretty flexible.</p>
<p>Enjoy (and if you need some, well, ask nicely :P).</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/07/04/the-lesser-known.html">The lesser known #win’s of Google+</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>A lot was said before, during and after. Google+ was unveiled to a lot of trumpets this past week and well, we have a serious well-thought out contender. My first impression — well it still holds — is it looks like the perfect fusion between Twitter — the interactivity, un-binding relationship (You don’t *have* to see my posts just because I want to see yours, and vice-versa), the free-flow of public data and sharing — and Facebook — the limitless posting, pictures, videos and locations. Minus the farmville. In HTML5. Dang.</p>
<p>I’m not leaving Twitter or Facebook yet. Twitter still holds value for news and initial interactions. The quick easy stuff. Facebook feels like a giant with way too many users to die (which is okay) but I think over time, and what I see from my current troupe of people, will live on for family and company pages.</p>
<p>A lot has been said already, but I want to highlight some very interesting — and maybe slightly underestimated #wins from Google.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/eb153-0s15d4gbrxtph5e8l.gif" /></figure>
<p><strong>The Google bar</strong>. For anyone that uses Gmail or Google to search, Google has steadily improved on the bar at the top, making it sleeker, more organized and so on. With the advent of G+, this bar has jumped to a new level. As expected, there’s a new +You option on the left. But: the integration and ease of posting and responding to posts using this bar is absolutely brilliant. Unlike Facebook that requires me to get on its site to view something (or open up an email), Google has setup a way that — quite literally — lets you leave everything as is and respond. I think it’s underestimated how easy they’ve made it. You can write entire posts, respond to any comments all without leaving your search window or Gmail. And it’s slick, too.</p>
<p><strong>Pushing content to the right people</strong>. This to me is less about privacy and more about sharing. Sharing baby pictures is something I’d do with close friends but not necessarily with the world, pictures from a trip I don’t want extended family in on — the list is endless. It looks like privacy, but it’s more about sharing to the right audience. That’s why the circles ideas work so well. I think it is only a matter of time before I have additional circles around people’s interests, and my interests towards them as part of our group dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>The one-stop shop</strong>. I don’t really think twitter tried to be this; on the contrary — current issues with development aside — twitter has relied on third parties to build frameworks around the messaging service. Photo-sharing, vid sharing, even link sharing came from outside first. While numbers might indicate a different trend, I do believe most power users prefer twitter clients to twitter web, still. G+ on the other hand is built as a one-stop shop. Over time, I’m sure we will see more platforms and companies integrating with it — pushing and possibly pulling content but the core platform is built for it all. Picture sharing integrated with Picasa, Location with Maps are built so seamlessly it’s tough to see why one needs to go anywhere else. Everyone’s raving about Hangouts as well. It’s a one-stop shop. That will mean a lot to a “new” social network user looking for an easy service to get started on. It will also mean — actually, has already meant — that savvy users are ditching using 2 or 3 services and merging them into one G+ account. There’s value there.</p>
<p>On a different note, I’m interested to see what value organizations can attach to Google+. From a management side of things. Twitter clients typically allow you to manage more than one account, so that makes it easy enough. FB on the other hand now allows you to act as your organization once you have pages you are an admin of. These options make it easy for organizations to use these platforms. The option to create company-specific Gmail accounts exists for now (since google doesn’t allow Apps uses to G+). I can’t confirm or deny yet how easy they will be to manage. But tell you what, I have an idea. Let’s see.</p>
<p>UPDATE, July 4: Well, the last paragraph is a tad pointless, according to <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-pages-coming-for-businesses-83985?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed-main" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE, July 4, 11:30 a.m.: Guess the google bar isn’t as underestimated. A new Chrome extension keeps the bar floating as you scroll and other improvements. Handy.</p>

        <p>AED250 for a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>Okay, granted that not technically accurate, but hear me out.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows me will know that I love my pizza. Not the Pizza Hut and Dominos nonsense, I’m talking <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13" target="_blank">real authentic stuff</a>. Light crust that is just a little charred, a good dollop of fresh mozzarella baked to perfection in a wood-fire oven. Frankly in Dubai, I’ve enjoyed that experience in a grand total of <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13" target="_blank">one location</a>, which has since shut down. But we’ve learnt to move on, haven’t we? Okay maybe not.</p>

As part of my reconnaissance mission, I walked around the entire place to find out everything I could about the attractions before we decided which ones to hit, I passed by what looked like an absolutely delicious slice of pizza. I ventured in to find a cross between a restaurant and something like a business- or first-class lounge at an airport, really. As I normally do, the first thing I checked out was their oven. A nice little brick deal but with conventional gas flame. Not my ideal kind, but I can live with that.</p>

<p>After we were done with our ‘adventure’ on the world’s fastest roller coaster, I dragged everyone in for a slice. I LOVED the mushroom pizza, of which I sadly do not have pictures. Frankly, and I’m pretty vocal about this, I do not like stuff on my pizza. Pizza to me, is defined by the crust, the sauce, the cheese. Finito. Okay one exception — mushrooms. Otherwise it’s just mozzarella and basil. Oh, heaven.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy the extravagant topped pizzas — take the Superbiotic at <a href="http://nkdpizza.com/" target="_blank">NKDPizza</a>, they’ve actually done it well, but to me, those don’t fall under the authentic Italian Pizza category. Moving on.</p>
<p>The Pizza at <a href="http://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/en-gb/shopping-and-dining/mamma-rossella.aspx" target="_blank">Mamma Rossella</a> was very well done. The crust was light enough while being a tad crisp and sauce didn’t interfere with the rest. The cheese was just your standard mozzarella (ie, not the fresh kind) but it worked. One caveat is that they make their pizzas frequently and stack them, so they reheat when you pick up a slice (yes, exactly like they would in say, New York) but it was still pretty good.</p>

<p>Before I talk about my problem with this whole scenario, I need to give their Olive Oil a shoutout. Yes, you heard me. Their Olive Oil must have been imported but it was amazing. Fresh, olivey and it tasted like it had been cold pressed an hour or so ago. It was so brilliant I took a picture of the bottle so I can try to hunt it down.</p>

<p>Right, so about the price. This is a bit of a dissapointment. The only way to get a slice is by making an AED243 payment (AED225 to get into Ferrari World and a basic cheese pizza slice is AED18). You basically can’t decide to drive up to Ferrari World just to grab a slice. Which if you know me, is something I would do for a slice of good pizza. The drive, not the pay.</p>
<p>I was able to find out — sadly — that this was their only branch, and they are negotiating with the big digs at Ferrari World to try and either get the restaurant area accessible without attending the “theme park” or get a mini-restaurant version outside the ticketed area; either of which are good for my purposes anyway. However, they did confirm they won’t be opening anywhere else for the moment, to maintain the exclusivity of being at Ferrari World.</p>

<blockquote>Apple is paving the way for taking Cloud technology to the masses, and all those who wouldn’t stop talking about how scary the cloud is. Free stops a lot of people from asking questions. Often, when speaking to customers about the fact that a lot of our technology offerings are based in the Cloud, you can already see that they’ve shown you the door. Talking to them about the benefits of the Cloud — the ease of use, availability from anywhere — doesn’t seem to change their minds, until they hear the words, “unlimited storage”, as is the case for <a href="http://www.cognitoit.com/e-mail-archiving.html" target="_blank">email archiving in the cloud</a>. Suddenly it sounds more interesting.</blockquote>

        <p>Saw an <a href="http://twitter.com/AtulChitnis/status/75773775345496064" target="_blank">interesting tweet</a> on my timeline this morning relating to first day at a first job and advice surrounding it. This became a great list of 20 tips (well, 19, since there was no 13th tip) that I think I would recommend anyone read — and in some cases, not just on their first job.</p>
<p>I may not be a veteran, but I can already see how this advice would have been incredibly useful. While I will confess I put a couple of them into practice at my first job, dang I wish someone had told me about the remaining 18. :)</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/05/31/why-twimbow-is.html">Why @twimbow is my favorite twitter client</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>UPDATE, 12 Sep 2012: </em><a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/35133587524/goodbye-twimbow" target="_blank"><em>Twimbow is no longer in active development</em></a><em>, and will be shut down once Twitter’s new APIs take over.</em></p>
<p>It started with a tweet.</p>
<p>I’ve been on twitter for some time (two and a half years as I write this) and tried out a few clients pretty early in that span. I rejected the Adobe AIR based apps — I really couldn’t stand the reactivity — and jumped to Seesmic’s Web app the second it was launched. Almost a year ago, I mentioned something about the app when I received a tweet from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/filos" target="_blank">@filos</a>, asking if I wanted to try a new app on the block called <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>. Never one to say no to a new piece of tech, I have been an avid <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> user since.</p>
<p>The other day I came across a post titled ’<a href="http://techcocktail.com/twimbow-the-%E2%80%9Capple%E2%80%9D-of-social-media-dashboards-2011-05" target="_blank">Twimbow: the ‘Apple’ of Social Media Dashboards</a>’ and I think I couldn’t have put it better than that. Having watched Twimbow from version 0.1 to the current 1.1, the client has matured and grown through an innovative approach and a smart expansion strategy.</p>
<p>To start off, Twimbow looks something like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fa701-0kyfgaglek6ap2xxl.png" /></figure>
<p>I actually wrote out this post twice. The first time, I attempted to list out every feature in <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> that I use and enjoy. Turns out, I use close to 100% of them and this post was too long to publish. So I’m going with another angle: the top 5 reasons why I use <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> over other clients. So here we go:</p>
<h4>Color</h4>
<figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/f3a71-0cxm7fzep-qlvhkvo.png" /></figure>
<p>Compared to the traditional dark on white, or white on dark client style, <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> takes an interesting spin, allowing you to assign color to users. Similar to Gmail’s labelling, starting with v1.0, you can assign label names. Considering I follow quite a few users, I’ve created a category for food-related things, another for news feeds and the like and so on. The cool bit is I can show and hide any label as required, so I’ve even created a label (in pink) for users I don’t want to see all the time, for example.</p>
<p>As a result, when I get online, I can quickly browse and focus on what I want to see by color, either by filtering out others, or even just skimming my timeline. If I’m in a hurry, I only look for colored users that are interesting, vs if I’m on at a more casual hour, when I browse them all.</p>
<h4>The Solution to the column problem</h4>
<p>Something that is quite annoying — and outright scary to newer twitter users — is the sheer number of columns generated with some of the other clients. There’s one for @, one for DMs and one for every search I have. If I’ve got multi-accounts, then there’s also one for each account and so on and so forth. <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> works in a 3-column environment and that’s it.</p>
<p>This is a perfect time to the mention the awesome and every intuitive Personal Buzz column. Everything related to you as a user — your tweets, @ mentions, DMs to and from, RTs by and of you and Favorites are nicely merged into one column. Mind, it’s color coded, so it’s easy to sort through them (or filter one or more out). I prefer the setting that hides my own tweets, DMs I send and RTs I do, simply because I’ve done them and know what they are already. This makes me happy. And always, if I’ve forgotten what someone replied to me, the conversation view sorts that out instantly.</p>
<p>Gone are the clients that make me feel like I work on Wall Street. Funnily enough, I get really annoyed trying to use them because it just does not feel organized anymore.</p>
<h4>Multi-Account Support</h4>
<p>The biggest change that arrived with 1.0 was <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>’s multi-account support. And boy did they think it through. Each account gets a separate view altogether, meaning you basically switch between your accounts. So far, other clients I have seen merge or have little check boxes to select which accounts to tweet from. Trust me, it’s amazingly easy to make a mistake that way as I’m sure many of you have experienced if you use a corporate and a personal account and such.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>’s way is simple and importantly — visible — so you don’t goof up accounts ever again. Haven’t made a mistake since. Yet.</p>
<h4>The Casual vs Power User</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> is a client that all facets of twitter users can enjoy. This means that the more casual users get to enjoy color coding, inbuilt music player and sharing, and even things like inline image previews (for all major image sharing services) and inline reader (to read links posted) so you don’t have to leave the application. Against this, there is something in for the power user too, easy (okay, very easy) list management, and the awesome monitor at the bottom. If you follow a lot of topics, the monitor allows you to save it like a little searchpad (Think Dashboard on the Mac) that you pull up only when there are updates. The monitor has a little status bar at the bottom that populates if any of your searches get new tweets in them. Handy.</p>
<h4>Responsiveness</h4>
<p>Out of experience, I’ve learnt the the guys behind <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> — should out to @filos and @marchitos — are very communicative. More importantly, they listen to user complaints or feature suggestions constantly. Over the course of the year, most of my suggestions have been taken into account (or was already in the works), and when they set out a private release of 1.0, I can confirm that they solved every issue I posted. To me, this says two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are passionate about what they are doing. I know for a fact that they are disgrunted users of others twitter apps who set out to create an innovative client that is based on what users like to see. So far, they’ve done a terrific job.</li>
<li>They care. They’re listening. A simple search of twimbow will show you how often users communicate with them, and how often they write back.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could, quite honestly, go on about <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a>. But the best thing about it is that you can see for yourself. <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> is currently in pre-alpha so it runs by invite only. I’ve got a couple to give out, and you can also visit <a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">their website</a>, where they showcase users who have invites available. Ofcourse, you can always tweet to them and they’ll put you on the invite list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twimbow.com" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> has recently set up an office in San Fran. To me, this is exciting, because they are getting serious about keeping this app running. For now, it just supports twitter, but Facebook etc are already in the works.</p>
<p>Take it for a spin!</p>
