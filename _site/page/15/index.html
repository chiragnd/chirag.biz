        <h2><a href="/2011/10/01/the-iced-tea.html">*The* Iced Tea, Brunetti</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I am a man of simple pleasures. And for those who know me, Iced Tea is my simplest pleasure. Which reminds me, I need to go place my iced tea bottle into the freezer for a quick chill.</p>
<p>Where was I again? Right, so this afternoon we strolled down to one of my favorite dessert shops, Brunetti. Jumping straight for the usual suspects, their little tiramisu container and some cappuccino, we wandered around to see what else attracted our eye. Their cheesecake looked alright, but sitting smugly next to it was a pear and cheese crumble that we proceeded to…crumble. Good stuff.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc00042" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/3a42fe5589.jpg" /></figure>
<figure><img alt="Dsc00044" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/5a89b332d7.jpg" /></figure>
<p>We also came across a Bacio. This was pretty much a chocolate mousse with some hazelnut but it looked oh so pretty with the little layer of chocolate around it.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc00039" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/cbb54dc088.jpg" /></figure>
<figure><img alt="Dsc00041" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/12cf675070.jpg" /></figure>
<p>As we started ordering drinks — we went with a cappuccino, espresso and an orange juice, I started fumbling, unable to decide as my impatient company towered over me telling me to hurry up, unable to understand why I needed more time than I was given while they decided. I tried to read a very italian name (which I will need to go back to Brunetti to get exactly and then update here Te freddo al limone) and was like man, I can’t imagine what that would be…until in little tiny characters I read the words that always get me going: homemade iced-tea with lemon. Voila!</p>
<p>I’ve got to set up a disclaimer here. When in the US, reading those words were like gold. It meant I was in for a treat. Out here sadly, the words iced tea tend to be abused pretty easily. So despite reading those words, and my general affinity for Brunetti, I expect little until this mammoth glass was deposited on the table.</p>
<p>The hell was this…?</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc00047" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/d397f4f2d0.jpg" /></figure>
<p>Yup, iced tea with a comfortable, convenient and yummy deposit of ice cream. Goodness me….goodness me.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc00049" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/0f88b14d8b.jpg" /></figure>
<figure><img alt="Dsc00050" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/28f3c1304f.jpg" /></figure>
<p>I’ve never seen it before (and that’s saying considering it’s a given that if there’s iced tea on the menu that’s not out of a can, I’ve ordered it), and I was amazed. We quite literally just stared at the thing for a while.</p>
<p>But this takes the cake, pun not intended. I seem to have found <em>the </em>iced tea. And interestingly, it has nothing to do with the ice cream at all. The tea itself was light, fresh as it could possibly be, with the right amount of mint without being overwhelming. (I realize everyone now thinks I’ve got to be insane to psycho-analyze iced tea, but hey…I yam, what I am.)</p>
<p>The ice cream itself was good, not too sweet, and somehow didn’t overly melt and ruin anything. Over time, it lightly drizzled itself into the tea without overwhelming it at all and considering most people have their tea with milk anyway, the taste was more than acceptable.</p>
<p>The iced tea itself runs you to AED24, which is slightly higher than what is normally out there (AED12–20) but it still on par with the general Brunetti value.</p>
<p>Goodness that was good iced tea.</p>
<p>Goodness, goodness me.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p>To this day, when I close my eyes and recall the shocking events from 10 years ago, somehow I’m still at a loss for words. Still cannot describe the event. Still.</p>
<p>The impact of the day is continued to be felt the world over. Every thing from the the economy to international relations has changed. Everything.</p>
<p>Ten years ago to this date and time, I was in a car, heading towards New York, when we saw the neon roadsigns telling us to avoid the city. A quick flip to the right radio station told us a plane had crashed into the first tower. I instantly reacted with “a suicide attack?” and people in the car laughed with a look of bewilderment on their face that I had come up with the option.</p>
<p>We pulled off the highway to a rest stop and watched CNN as the second plane crashed. Eyes wide open, complete silence in the crowd that had started to gathered there, unable to eat the fast food on their tables. Someone in our party turned to me and said ‘Oh my god, you were right.“</p>
<p>I have never wanted to be more wrong.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A moment of silence, for those who suffered, and for those who continue to suffer. May they have courage to withstand the years ahead.</p>

<p>We all love a good sponge cake. Now close your eyes and imagine that instead of a sweet, sugar-rushing sponge cake, you have a savory, slightly spicy, salty delicious sponge cake. Yes I realize you can’t read this if you closed your eyes, but I’m also relying on the fact that no one listens to me anyway.</p>
<p>A Gujarati specialty, Khaman is the equivalent of a savory sponge cake, with just the right amount of spice and flavor, and topped with a tempering of mustard and garnished with coriander and sometimes, grated coconut. Most people have a weakness for this gram-flour deliciousness, considering it can be eaten all by itself, or dipped in the chutney of the day.</p>
<p>I have even managed — wait for it — to make a Khaman sandwich that tasted so awesome, it’s now a standard occurance every time there’s Khaman in the house.</p>
<p>So there you have it, the savory and slightly spicy sponge cake, the Khaman.</p>

        <p>As news of Steve Jobs’ resignation flutters through the cyberspace, most people pronouncing this the end of an era. It is. Steve Jobs may not have had the agreement of every John and Jane Doe, but we definitely had the respect of a man who knew what he was doing, often way ahead of his peers.</p>
<p>What struck me is that this was a matter of time — not his first medical leave for one — and yet it comes with a level of shock and surprise, going to show how larger than life the man is.</p>
<p>A tribute to the man who envisioned a new era to computing, and pretty much got us there.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Famous words from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryst_with_destiny" target="_blank">inspiring speech</a>. India celebrates another year of independence, and there’s a lot on my mind.</p>
<p>Every year on this day, I introspect a little. What does this day really mean to me? The answer is weird. It means a lot — and yet, it somehow means so little. I feel patriotic, I feel inspired, I love the tri-colors fluttering everywhere, I’ve attended the flag hoisted ceremonies organized as far out as Philadelphia. Yet I come up with an empty feeling when I think about what I have done. For my country. At all.</p>
<p>The thoughts take me broader, farther. I think of the world. Of the crises and of <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/08/london_riots.html" target="_blank">the mess</a>. And I re-call <a href="http://www.farscape.com/" target="_blank">my favorite TV show</a> of all time, one that — as it drew to a close — highlighted what it means to be human, not Indian or American or Middle-eastern, or anything else for that matter. What we can achieve as a species, and what <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/08/london_riots.html" target="_blank">we are destroying</a>. Of political power, and corruption, racism and hatred and cold war.</p>
<p>Is this what we are really about? If so, I genuinely don’t feel like being human on those occasions.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I think I want to focus on what needs to change, rather than what cannot be touched or controlled.</p>
<p>Over the last year, maybe a couple years, I started to find my call, and interestingly, it lies in technology (and <a href="http://www.naihar.com" target="_blank">food</a>, but that’ll kill my point right now). Over the last few years, I’ve <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/web-apps-the-here-and-now-0" target="_blank">witnessed</a>, thought about and <a href="http://blog.cognitoit.com/saas-and-the-symbiosis-between-it-business" target="_blank">complained</a> about changes in technology, the impact it’s having on our day-to-day lives. I have <a href="http://blog.cognitoit.com/saas-and-the-symbiosis-between-it-business" target="_blank">some clear thoughts</a> on what I think technology should be doing, which inturn defines what it shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>
<p>A lot has changed since the advent of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> was around way longer, but it was always a closed network — something to help you create a close-by community, or keep in touch with your friends and family. Twitter opened it all up — by giving us access to people we’d never be “friends” with in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> paradigm but could still interact with without losing the feeling of privacy and control. It became a news feed, a community builder and a conversation starter all in one. In India, this has grown over the last couple of years. Today news channels regularly display opinions collected via <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/timesofindia" target="_blank">twitter</a> (and even <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TimesofIndia" target="_blank">facebook</a>). It is starting to bring people together, giving them a voice and channelize support (or opposition).</p>
<p>I think this will slowly but surely impact governance in India. Sadly, our political system is 64 years old (and not in the good way) and well, rubbish. In India, there is a large group of people who think the political system is pointless to bother with. But there’s a young upcoming group of this generation who is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/India-Against-Corruption-Dubai-Solidarity-Forum/194856737219541" target="_blank">going out there</a> to make their point too. It may take a few years, but social media is going to help improve it, and with it, things will change.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>The broader technology scope is equally interesting. I frankly hate a lot about the status quo, and more importantly, the attitude people have towards technology — especially in the corporate area. I’ve been looked down upon, called an idiot and laughed at purely because one look at me makes people know I’m an Indian IT guy, and then I must be like <a href="http://search.dilbert.com/search?p=R&amp;srid=S3%2d4&amp;lbc=dilbert&amp;w=Outsource&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fdilbert%2ecom%2fstrips%2fcomic%2f2010%2d02%2d12%2f&amp;rk=1&amp;uid=423127987&amp;sid=2&amp;ts=custom&amp;rsc=33QnUk4JSgg1gJLa&amp;method=and&amp;isort=date&amp;view=list&amp;filter=type%3acomic" target="_blank">every Indian IT guy</a>. It’s a funny kind of racism.</p>
<p>I’ve even been told that people are moving away from working with Indians because the cost-reduction does not offset the time and energy required to get Indians up to speed and up to the right level of professional working since we are “so far behind”. Is this what and where we want to be?</p>
<p>It is time to change that.</p>
<p>It’s our own damned fault too, and it needs to change with us first. Indians in technology need to stop coming off as bookworms, because we can be so much more. We need to stop rejecting new technologies and fighting over <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/technology/will-india-ban-the-blackberry-43817" target="_blank">stupid bans</a>, and focus on what we can do to improve the way we do things. Starting with education. And not stopping there. In some arenas, technology is so backward it’s not even laughable. I’ve even had <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/reliance-part-iii-and-im-done" target="_blank">bad experiences even with the big names</a> and the way they treat us, their customers, fellow Indians.</p>
<p>This is an open call to any organization in India who wants to change they way they do things, and the way they use technology, and need advice. Heck, I’ll even do as much as I can of it for free. All I ask is you have an open mind to embrace what I have to say and accept that there needs to be a change in attitude. If you don’t like what I have to say after that, no problem. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chiragnd" target="_blank">Tweet</a>, drop me a line on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/chiragnd" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://gplus.to/chiragnd" target="_blank">Google+</a>, whatever.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.cognitoit.com/news/cognito-announces-launch-of-cloud-based-web--email-security-in-india-1570283.html" target="_blank">started it</a> a little bit too. And while it hasn’t been easy, I will keep trying until technology peers in India — the local, day-to-day folks just as much as the big guns — change their attitude towards technology, operations and most importantly — the way they treat their users, customers and us in general.</p>
<p>It’s an odd goal, I know, but this is how I can contribute.</p>
<p>How will you?</p>

        <p>It continually amazes me to see the kind of creativity that comes out of American movies and TV. As I finally watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/" target="_blank">Sucker Punch</a> this week, this was more evident than ever.<br /><br />There is so much creativity in the telling of this story. When I compare that against the real run of the mill rubbish we see in bollywood or on Indian tv…I quite literally, have no words.</p>
<p>I think that, in the Bollywood paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>a movie like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978764/" target="_blank">Sucker Punch</a> wouldn’t have been conceptualized</li>
<li>if we assume for a second that it could have been, no one would have been ready to fund it</li>
<li>if it had been funded, not one ‘mainstream’ish actor would have found the script worthy enough (and)</li>
<li>if one had, they probably couldn’t actually have pulled it off</li>
<li>very few people would have gone to watch it</li>
<li>some politician would have opposed the way young girls were portrayed, and possibly, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCwQqQIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fentertainment%2Fbollywood%2Fnews-interviews%2FPending-preview-Punjab-bans-Aarakshan%2Farticleshow%2F9564070.cms&amp;ei=J3tFToHREI_PsgaP5civBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm2sYtX8W0k0nhIjrhg-8M9-iQmw" target="_blank">banned it</a>
</li>
<li>All in all, it would have been a big enough mess to deter anyone from even voicing the idea</li>
</ul>
<p>On 100% of current Indian television, we still haven’t gotten past the ‘oh-my-god my mother-in-law is insane’ storyline.</p>
<p>It’s sad really.</p>

<p>Anyone who’s driven around Abu Dhabi a bit will notice Il Forno outlets spread around the city. Boasting authentic food, the real reason I wanted to try it out was because someone who tried out my <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-pizza-13" target="_blank">favorite pizzeria in Dubai</a> (which has since shut down) said he had liked Il Forno better.</p>
<p>Not one to take criticism poorly, I tried it.</p>
<p>One bite in and Il Forno fell into the category of just another pizza place. They’re not bad, but they’re not great either. I only tried their pizza — I went with their garlic-and-olive-oil option — and felt mostly like I was eating a couple-hours-old manakish. The crust was overwhelming, didn’t feel too fresh and the cheese was your usual unfrozen mozzarella. The iced tea I had with the pizza was your standard run-of-the-mill restaurant iced tea and not brewed or such either.</p>
<figure><img alt="Dsc03681_1" src="http://www.chirag.biz/uploads/2018/b76eb96cb4.jpg" /></figure>
<p>Il Forno works with something that does look like a woodfire oven, although it’s a pretty standard one in reality. The staff were friendly though and while I’ve only tried their pizzas on a couple different occasions, it’s been with the same results.</p>
<p>For those following closely, the search continues for good pizza in the UAE. There are some <a href="http://www.naihar.com/pizza-mamma-rossella" target="_blank">I like</a>, some I don’t and others I despise (and therefore, haven’t really visited since the start of this blog). But I’ve received some <a href="http://foodiva.net/2011/07/dubais-best-pizza-emporio-armani-caffe/" target="_blank">good suggestions</a> and will post up once I get a chance to try them out. All in all, Il Forno is not going to be my favorite pizza anytime soon.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I received a DM over twitter that went: “Is this you: <a href="http://t.co/GAVYjLo" target="_blank">http://t.co/GAVYjLo</a>?"</p>
<p>Oh relax, it wasn’t spam — well that was when twitter wasn’t so infected anyway. Point is, it was linked to a foodblog (go ahead, click it), but the friend had confused it as being this blog because of “eerily similar[ity] to u!” Another food blog? With much better pictures? Ooh. I <a href="http://www.foodonymph.com/spicy-venue-set-my-tongue-ablaze-and-i-still-crawled-back-to-beg-for-more/" target="_blank">hastily posted</a> what I can only imagine now was a <a href="http://www.foodonymph.com/spicy-venue-set-my-tongue-ablaze-and-i-still-crawled-back-to-beg-for-more/" target="_blank">creepy comment</a> and didn’t think anything of it afterward. Who responds to blog comments right? A grand total of 4 minutes later, I received an email titled “Hi — just saw your comment on my blog :)”.</p>
<p>Today, Famished in Arabia (or FiA) as we were coined, is a group of 56 food bloggers (as of 8 p.m. GMT+4 today) covering various walks of life and blogging about a whole variety of different things — from expert restaurant reviews, expert bakers, expert pickle-makers, expert restaurant owners and.. well there’s me too. The group has seen a phenomenal growth — oh a history buff you say? you want <a href="http://www.foodonymph.com/uae-food-bloggers/" target="_blank">ALL the details</a>? — anyway, the rest of you, like I was saying…</p>
<p>Today Famished in Arabia celebrates a year of existance. And what a marvelous one at that. Some very creative people, some very talented people and most importantly some very passionate people. This means that as the site grows, the information flowing gets even better — new places worth checking out, suggestions on evening-outings, and even tips on cooking and baking better. Even more, how to photograph food — some of the <a href="http://www.naihar.com/modak" target="_blank">improvements</a> (What rubbish you say? You haven’t seen any? Pfft, <a href="http://www.naihar.com/thepla" target="_blank">go away</a>!) you see on this blog over the past year have happened because of things I’ve picked up by just admiring all of these blogs.</p>
<p>Right, so what’s the point of the post you ask? Well it’s to say Happy Birthday FiA. It’s to be happy and proud to see it grow into something great — just think about it, for a country like UAE, to have 56 independent food bloggers each with their own unique voice. That’s amazing. And you know what? I’m actually sure there are more out there, waiting until the silent assassins..er…acquirers at FiA pounce and draw them in with cupcakes…</p>
<p>I leave you with the <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F17537357499653494349%2Fbundle%2FFood%20Bloggers%20UAE" target="_blank">RSS feed aggregate</a> of the food bloggers, and if you’re on twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chiragnd/famished-in-arabia" target="_blank">the FiA list</a>. Go nuts! Just don’t <a href="http://www.naihar.com/devils-food-cake-topped-with-chocolate-ganach" target="_blank">forget the chocolate</a>.</p>

<p>I remember this tweet someone wrote before going offline for a few months very vividly. I’m not entirely sure why, but it just stuck. Maybe because it resonated with me somehow. Maybe..I’m not sure.</p>
<p>I saw this coming I think. It’s not often that I lose my temper, in fact, it happens rarely enough that I cannot recall the last time I did it. But over the last month or so, I was brimming. I could feel it happening with every conversation — and it wasn’t just one person. Today, I lost it altogether. I’m not happy about that. It may not have been a disaster, but it still was not good.</p>
<p>So today, we start again. A little rehash, a little time-alone, a little bit of introspection. The outcome, as before, will be the same: return to the patient side of me, the one that dominates without chaos, and the one who’s shoulder people like to cry on because it is offered without judgement; one that would never expect a shoulder in return.</p>
<p>It is time.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t love candy. Come to think of it, I can’t think of anyone who’s ever told me they hate Gummies. Maybe not biggest fans, but don’t like Gummies. Yea, NEVER happens. Gummies are things that you can’t stop eating once you start, then you feel sick and tell yourself, okay not having *that* many again. Until a couple of days later, you walk by a store that sells gummies and…pfft, what’s another entire pack going to do — I survived fine last time!</p>
<p>I indulged heavily in gummies — gummy bears &amp; worms in particular during my stay in Philadelphia. With everything from the next block grocery store to the elaborate candy stores carry them, they were never in short supply. Over time, you even new which ones carried fresh gummies (yes, there is such a thing as ‘fresh’ gummies compared to stale ones. It matters!).</p>
<p>Moving back to Dubai meant a literal cut down in the amount of gummy intake. That probably wasn’t a bad thing but you also don’t find gummies around the block, and when you do, they just seem expensive. Ofcourse, all has changed over time and I can safely say I can find gummies within a 10 minute radius from whereever I am these days.</p>
<p>This however, brings me to <a href="http://www.wrigley.com/global/brands/life-savers.aspx" target="_blank">Lifesavers</a>. For the uninitiated, Lifesavers can be best described as the American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_%28sweet%29" target="_blank">Polo</a>. Well, you don’t actually get Polo there, and you see Lifesavers everywhere. Frankly they don’t really come close on a taste front, but they make do. What Polo however doesn’t have, are…Lifesavers gummies! Those brilliant, mint-candy-with-a-hole-shaped soft gummies. So good. Case in point: when I touched down in the US last year for the first time in 4 years, the only thing I wanted oh-so-badly along with my Snapple Iced Tea obsession were, yup, the Lifesavers Gummies. And yes, they are joined by the 7–11 Big Gulp.</p>

<p>The good news is, the ENOC petrol station store has started featuring Lifesavers, including the big versions, but in hard candy. Everytime I stop by to fill up the tank — even if more than once a day at the same station — I make a quick move into the store purely to check out the Lifesavers aisle in the sad-puppy-dog-eye hope. So far, I’ve been disappointed.</p>
<p>Lifesavers, are you listening?</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/07/22/first-impressions-lion.html">First Impressions: Lion (OS X 10.7)</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <figure><img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/01412-0vuzimzxkmoh5s-yw.png" /></figure>
<p>My early thoughts on the all-new Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion — image via <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>), in trademarked bullet-point style:</p>
<ul>
<li>I upgraded to a new OS for all of $30 and did not step out of my room. While this appeals to my height of laziness, you have to say that is an impressive way to function. The installation took about 35 minutes in total, not counting download time (a little over an hour).</li>
<li>(Update) Case in point, it just took me &gt;30 minutes to download the 30MB new VLC.</li>
<li>I decided to leave the new scrolling as is and test it for a while first. In a couple of hours, the new scrolling is happening a lot more intuitively. I definitely like how full screen apps are being handled — pretty much a separate virtual desktop that you can scroll in and out of easily.</li>
<li>I’m having am amazing time using <a href="http://www.twimbow.com/" target="_blank">Twimbow</a> — or I’d imagine any twitter-like application — scrolling through twitter columns is now identical to using an iPhone.</li>
<li>Mission Control is a brilliant add-on. Actually it’s not so much mission control itself, but the way this has been integrated with the new scrolling and the virtual desktops mode. Very seamless, intuitive to move around and it does what you think it would do. I also like that Dashboard has now setup its own screen on the far left (similar to the search screen on the iOS). It handles dual desktop better than before.</li>
<li>What remains to be seen is how seamless the change will be between using a Magic Mouse and using the trackpad. At my desk I use an external keyboard and mouse, whereas often during the day or when out, I’m glistening about the trackpad. Now the gestures are a bit different between them for some of the tasks, so it might take more than one try to get it right based on the input device.</li>
<li>I’m not so sure about the Mail app yet. I’m a active <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank">Gmail</a> user for both personal and work, part of the reason is that they offer a significantly improved interface and controls, and the other part is my not having to manage my inbox and archive and so on and so forth — a major pain in Outlook days. Apple seems to have got the interface down real well, I’ll give them that, but I’m not as fast on it as I’d be on <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank">Gmail</a>, simply with the shortcuts — I use keyboard almost entirely to sort, shift, search, archive, delete and send email in <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank">Gmail</a>. Tab+Space vs Command-Shift-D? Yeaaa, no. That said, the interface is smooth, clean and the use in full screen mode can be very productive and focused. For now I’ll use it on and off, but the lack of labels and keyboard ease of use will deter me as a full-time Mail user. However, I can completely see why normal users (ie, non-heavy-gmail, outlook or previous Mail users) would be very happy with it.</li>
<li>So far, I’ve not run into an app compatabilities. However, apps that would improve upon the finder, such as say <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>which adds menu options have lost these, so a re-install will be necessary. At the same time, a variety of my pre-Lion preferences (such as changing my screenshot folder) have stayed on.</li>
<li>The all new account syncing is actually quite good, although surprising. Using my stored account info the keychain, it managed to figure out that I used 3 chat accounts that also had calendar, contacts and email attached to it, imported the accounts and gave me a prompt to chose what I wanted synchronized. Nifty.</li>
<li>I also get a feeling that the Dock is on its way out. I was barely using it anyway — a combination of <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a> and Spotlight pretty much give me everything I’d want — but with Launchpad coming on as a visual ‘Let me see all my apps’ option…</li>
<li>Finder, and just general interface wise, it’s looking a bit more polished. The buttons looks almost Chrome-HTML5 like and snazzier, and there are definitely some adjustments to contrast, shading and general whiteness.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s still early days. Still, 1 million downloads on Day 1 is pretty staggering (think $30m revenue and no shipping/box costs). I haven’t tried everything yet, particularly Resume &amp; Versioning.</p>
<p>Overall, I think I now understand <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>’s Back to the Mac campaign a lot better. They have learnt some sharp lessons from the iOS adoption and incorporated them with good insight into the OS. Launchpad, Scrolling and Full Screen apps are great additions to both experience and productivity — and mission control seems to be a much-upgraded version of Spaces+Dashboard without losing their usefulness. I’m happy so far.</p>
<p>Be happy to hear your thoughts too!</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Well for the two loyal readers this blog actually has, they’ll know <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/as-the-posters-say-it-all-ends" target="_blank">I got in to the premiere viewing</a> of the final installment of the Harry Potter series. I’ve been a huge fan of the books since I first read them in 2001 and frankly most of the movies tended to disappoint. But that’s normal with adaptations — you lose out on the subtleties, additional plotlines and in the case of Harry Potter, I feel we lost the inherent sarcasm that he spews oh so easily in the books.</p>
<p>That said, my overall verdict for the final installment is: satisfied.</p>
<p>As expected, there were a few changes, but I was definitely happy to see a lot of dialogue was imported straight off the books and the intensity was just as captivating. I’m not much of a review writer, but I am very much of a bullet-pointer and therefore, I give you — the bullet-pointed review. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li>I was constantly amused that wand translated to ‘baguette’ in the French subtitles.</li>
<li>Knowing that Flitwick and Griphook are played by the same person enforced on me that they looked like brothers. TO be fair, he carried out the role real well.</li>
<li>Bellatrix. Gosh. She does such a good job really, does Helena Carter. Even as Hermoine she’s rather convincing. The character is one of those love to hate</li>
<li>McGonagal was brilliant. I’m really glad they included the Locomotor spell, with a nice little quip. I wasn’t thrilled they left out her threat to Slughorn to have Slytherin choose an allegiance. The line “we duel to kill” in the book always gave me goosebumps.</li>
<li>Aberforth was awesome. Loved his character and it was unfortunate he had limited screen time but he had the tone and attitude correct, unlike Gambon’s Albus has been.</li>
<li>“The boy who lived, come to die.” Brilliant. That entire sequence was perfect.</li>
<li>Seconds after I thought to myself, where in Merlin’s Beard is Hagrid, he showed up on screen.</li>
<li>The Battle of Hogwarts lives up to expectation. The scenes, intensity, darkness and the fact that we got to see (again) a lot of the characters in small roles was great. I did miss John Cleese though.</li>
<li>Caveat (and a little bit of a spoiler). I’ve spoken to a couple who felt that they handled it well but I was not entirely thrilled with the last 15–20 minutes. It wasn’t bad, I just felt it could have been better, although I will say that outside of that, the movie surpassed my expectations. However, for me the end scenes were about the conversations Harry and Voldemort have. I missed that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I leave you with some thoughts from people sitting around me before the start of the premiere:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I cried at the end of the book wonder what’s going to happen in this movie!”</li>
<li>And my favorite: “If I haven’t seen part 1 is that okay?”</li>
</ul>
