        <p>Harry Potter and GoF: Overall 4.75 stars</p>
<p>Very well made, indeed, considering they had to squeeze twice the size compared to PoA in the same time frame.</p>
<p>I wasn’t too crazy about the ending…they could’ve spent more time explaining and less time sending the Durmstrangs and Beauxbatons away. Ah well.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort was pretty well done, as were the three tasks.</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra. Green light.</p>

        <p>I have some awwwweeesomely awesome residents!<br /><br />First they come with cake and cards and balloons at midnight. Then they decorate my little passageway for me in the morning. And when the day was gloomy and the weather went bad…I read the card, and it was perfect! Literally, the best birthday card ever!!!<br /><br />So then my staff wished me and made sure I remembered my birthday. <br /><br />Then my cousin gave me her and my parents’ presents.<br /><br />I got wished by my cousins and family and friends. I got tons and tons of facebook messages. Thanks everyone for those, I will reply to each of you within the next couple of days!<br /><br />And then, we went on a C&amp;C generals rampage until 3 a.m! Totally this floor’s computer game of all time.<br /><br /> — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — –<br /><br />If you ever had a birthday, and wanted it sooo badly again, for me it was when I turned 22.<br /><br /> — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -<br /><br />I don’t normally give special shoutouts, because everyone just has an equal share. But from everyone I heard today, there was one name that really stood out.<br />I have to have a special secret shoutout to LND. LND is amazingly awesome, and put together a lot of the efforts. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH.</p>

        <p>I don’t know…I’m a little confused…bewildered even.<br /><br />Just when there are so many clouds, there is a small opening where the sun’s light comes through with just enough warmth.</p>
<p>So I ran into a friend today. I had spoken to her after a year last weekend, and we decided to meet tomorrow. Then today she suddenly called me and asked if I wanted to grab a coffee…I said ok.</p>
<p>It was simply awesome! I haven’t feel so much warmth come my way in a while. On our walk back to the dorm, she started making fun of me about something. I just looked at her, and she was like, ok fine, I’ve missed you too. *hug* it felt sooo good. I was shocked enough not to be able to respond for a few seconds. But I hugged her back, telling her I had missed her too.</p>
<p>Wow…I’m all warm inside now :) I can’t wait for the dinner tomorrow.</p>

        <p>The interesting thing about quotes is that you hear them all the time. What’s also notable about the quotable is that they’re pretty much common sense, things we know to be true; yet someone has to quote them, in a nice poetic style and that’s what sticks.</p>

<p>This was the thought that hit him as he walked by, with the winds against him, fighting him, trying to make him stop, to go back, to command their direction onto him. Yet he stood firm. At first he did not move, then slowly he continued his journey, opposite to the forces pushing him. With time, the winds gave up.</p>
<p>He realized as he walked into the building…it’s never about reaching your goal, it’s about how you got there.</p>
