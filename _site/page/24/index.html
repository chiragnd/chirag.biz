      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><em>Originally posted at the Shufflegazine Blog (no longer exists)</em></p>
<p>I’ve been using Google Chrome as my default browser for some time. What amazed me from the start was the sleek interface. Getting rid of the extra menu bars was, in my opinion, one of the smartest design moves on a browser. The extra screen space was phenomenal, yes every little pixel of it. There were others, such as one single box (affectionately called the omni-box) for address and search (and admin options), but it was the overall interface and screen space that really caught my eye. Speed is also something I’ve enjoyed with Chrome. I honestly can’t really tell the difference between how fast a page loads against, say, Firefox, but the speed with which Chrome as an application operates — from starting up to opening tabs — is definitely an improvement over other browsers.</p>
<p>Chrome, for those who don’t know it, is based on an open source project called Chromium. As part of the Chromium project, Google has made the browser available on Linux and Mac platforms in line with the Chrome releases, as a developer edition. Ofcourse this meant that while its stability was not guaranteed, test versions of the browser have been available for some time. Last week, Google <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chrome-for-mac-goes-beta.html" target="_blank">finally announced</a> the release of the beta version of Chrome for the Mac. This finally puts Chrome into contention against Safari and Firefox on the Mac. In addition, Google has unveiled a larger and constantly growing extensions gallery, to rival Firefox extensions.</p>
<p>The question is then, can Chrome do what it did on the PC — move into the top 3 browsers in a year? Users are already raving about its speed, but stability is something that has to be proven over time. In addition, it seems that extensions are not yet available for the Mac, something Google will have to fix soon if they want to really sway hardcore Firefox users.</p>
<p>One thing’s for certain, IE is nowhere in the picture.</p>

        <p>So another year has come and gone. Honestly, this year, I had no expectations. Outside of going to buy myself a new desk chair, no presents were in line either.</p>
<p>It started around 11:40 p.m. when some of my twitter buddies started their countdown to the birthday, and happy birthday songs exploded at midnight — an extremely pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Followed by a morning breakfast and my day couldn’t have been better. While it didn’t entirely get much better due to a hospital visit at the end of the day, the wishes and messages definitely made me smile.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Geekfest 2.0, the following night, where I got wished in person by a lot of tweeple, only to then be surprised by an ice-cream cake by someone who knew that I had to spend the previous evening at the hospital. Sometimes, you are surprised when you least expect it.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

        <p>Right, so no surprises the posts have been few and far between.</p>
<p>I have been embracing the online revolution in the meantime. Twitter and fb. It’s amazing what an online presence they give you — we’re also trying that out company-wise, so I’d like to see how we are able to work that into the scheme of things.</p>
<p>Other than that, there’s not a lot. Work is pushing along, things are moving in routine, and there are signs it might pick up. But at least I’ve been on the move a little. Driving around always seems to keep me happy.</p>
<p>Right, speaking of the revolution, I’ve also adopted the iPhone. Phenomenal gadget in its own right, albeit with a few flaws. But they’re fairly new, and there’s good scope for improvement. I’d be very interested to see what happens in June.</p>
<p>Finally — and this seems to be the common theme around the world — is the need for a vacation. My last attempt at it didn’t quite work out, heck, it didn’t anything out and I’m still recovering from that. At least I know not to visit a gym the first day of vacation. Ever.</p>

        <p>It’s been a while as usual. Things moving along at a fairly slow pace. Everyone’s waiting for everything to pick up, which doesn’t bode well, so to speak.</p>
<p>Weekends have been busy off late, though for good reasons. Seem to be regaining good use of my leg again, which is a relief.</p>
<p>So, twitter. The new obsession. Cheeky how something that simple, that has been a small part of bigger Web sites — the status update — spurned its own website and apparent new revolution. What will people think of next? Actually, I don’t want the answer to that…yet.</p>
<p>So now my facebook, twitter and bb are all connected. Good enough for me. Now let’s see how regular I can be about the updates and following…</p>

        <p>Right, so…been a while….and LOTS has happened.</p>
<p>But interestingly, I don’t have to type them, because very few people read this, and they should know by now. In any event *cough* I’m alive and kicking.</p>
<p>So, based on one of (rather interesting) comments I received, it is interesting about stereotypes. I mean, just because I blog doesn’t mean I’m truly “blogger” type. And I’ve noticed that there are people who never seem to be heading in this directionand turns out they blog a lot, and rather well.</p>
<p>The world’s full of surprises.</p>
<p>I must include here a small tribute to RJB. Buddy, what happened shouldn’t have, and we both know it couldn’t entirely be avoided. But here’s to better times, and the hope that things return to normal as soon as humanly possible.</p>
<p>Back to business…and to stressful times…*cough* *cough*</p>

        <p>Well I’ve finally got the green light to get rid of all the “assistances” while walking and beginning minor activity..wohoo! Slowly but surely I’m getting there. Although the folks can’t be bothered…they’re staying cautious, and all I want to do is run around like no tomorrow. Oh, and drive. I miss driving.</p>
<p>So I ran a question on chat the other day asking if people thought I was a blog-writing type of person. I have to admit, I was totally surprised to learn *everyone* thought I was. I’ve never really been the writing type. Creative maybe. Editor, oh yeah. But writing a LOT was just never my thing. Apparently the world doesn’t think so…sigh…</p>
<p>Well anyway, I’m starting to pen thoughts here, let’s see how often I keep it up. Time for my exercises. Learning to walk was more fun when I was one.</p>

        <p>I have some awwwweeesomely awesome residents!<br /><br />First they come with cake and cards and balloons at midnight. Then they decorate my little passageway for me in the morning. And when the day was gloomy and the weather went bad…I read the card, and it was perfect! Literally, the best birthday card ever!!!<br /><br />So then my staff wished me and made sure I remembered my birthday. <br /><br />Then my cousin gave me her and my parents’ presents.<br /><br />I got wished by my cousins and family and friends. I got tons and tons of facebook messages. Thanks everyone for those, I will reply to each of you within the next couple of days!<br /><br />And then, we went on a C&amp;C generals rampage until 3 a.m! Totally this floor’s computer game of all time.<br /><br /> — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — –<br /><br />If you ever had a birthday, and wanted it sooo badly again, for me it was when I turned 22.<br /><br /> — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -<br /><br />I don’t normally give special shoutouts, because everyone just has an equal share. But from everyone I heard today, there was one name that really stood out.<br />I have to have a special secret shoutout to LND. LND is amazingly awesome, and put together a lot of the efforts. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH.</p>

        <p>May be this is what I wanted,<br />To stay in peace away from you,<br />It’s sad, it’s true, may be things are best now that we are through.</p>
<p>May be I am happy that it got no further,<br />I did not have to confront my feelings for you.<br />Every time my mind repeats the scene, I get firmer,<br />May be this time I will forget you.</p>
<p>May be I should have told you that I love you.<br />May be its best if I dont pretend,<br />Everything hurts so much right now,<br />I wish may be we’d never met.</p>
<p>Yet it isnt all your fault.<br />I set my self up for the fall.<br />And though thinking may be, may be makes it better,<br />There really was no may be there at all.</p>

        <p>I don’t know…I’m a little confused…bewildered even.<br /><br />Just when there are so many clouds, there is a small opening where the sun’s light comes through with just enough warmth.</p>
<p>So I ran into a friend today. I had spoken to her after a year last weekend, and we decided to meet tomorrow. Then today she suddenly called me and asked if I wanted to grab a coffee…I said ok.</p>
<p>It was simply awesome! I haven’t feel so much warmth come my way in a while. On our walk back to the dorm, she started making fun of me about something. I just looked at her, and she was like, ok fine, I’ve missed you too. *hug* it felt sooo good. I was shocked enough not to be able to respond for a few seconds. But I hugged her back, telling her I had missed her too.</p>
<p>Wow…I’m all warm inside now :) I can’t wait for the dinner tomorrow.</p>

        <p>The interesting thing about quotes is that you hear them all the time. What’s also notable about the quotable is that they’re pretty much common sense, things we know to be true; yet someone has to quote them, in a nice poetic style and that’s what sticks.</p>
