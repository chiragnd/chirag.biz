      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Interesting (and rather valid) point of view on startups, on why it’s possible for startups that later in the game are more successful because they execute better.</p>
<blockquote>Suppose you have an idea for a startup, and then do some research only to discover there are already similar products on the market. You become disheartened and wonder if you should abandon your idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In fact, the existence of competing products is a meaningful signal, but not necessarily a negative one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>…</blockquote>
<blockquote>1) Almost every good idea has already been built. Sometimes new ideas are just ahead of their time. There were probably 50 companies that tried to do viral video sharing before YouTube.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Other times existing companies simply didn’t execute well. Google and Facebook launched long after their competitors, but executed incredibly well and focused on the right things. When Google launched, other search engines like Yahoo, Excite, and Lycos were focused on becoming multipurpose “portals” and had de-prioritized search (Yahoo even outsourced their search technology).</blockquote>
<blockquote>2) The fact that other entrepreneurs thought the idea was good enough to build can be a positive signal. They probably went through some kind of vetting process like talking to target users and doing some market research. By launching later, you can piggyback off the work they’ve already done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>3) That other people tried your idea without success could imply it’s a bad idea or simply that the timing or execution was wrong. Distinguishing between these cases is hard and where you should apply serious thought.</blockquote>

<p>Day 2 in Philadelphia, and a visit to Reading Terminal Market was in order. To the uninitiated, Reading Terminal Market is best described as a farmer’s market with an awesome hotchpotch of options. True to its style, and enclosed in a just-right closed space within Center City Philadelphia — 12th and Arch to be precise — Reading Terminal offers a wide variety of foods, from baked goods to flowers, meats &amp; seafood to produce and a number of eateries.</p>
<p>Due to my intense desire to fill as many attractions as I could in my short stay, we hit RTM (sorry, I can’t be expected to type out the entire name each time, and copy-paste stops my smooth flow of typing, but I digress) rather early in the morning, but the place was quite bustling for 8.30 a.m. on a weekday. Since it’s right of Philly’s Market East station, it’s got a perfect location for a quick breakfast, a drop by for lunch during a busy day, or a stopover for supplies to take home at the end of the day. They also offer student discounts on Sundays &amp; Tuesdays, so if you are one, or know one, that’d be the day to go.</p>
<p>The market is a delight to the retina, and ??I’ve tried to capture as many of the colors as I could.</p>
<p>We stocked up on some basic supplies comprising organic vegetables, and attempted a place called the Basic Vegetarian Snack Bar for a quick bite. Our reason for picking them — they had every conceivable dish you could think of, from the chili burger to the traditional Philadelphia Cheesestake — but made with organic vegetarian ingredients. The best description on their menu was for the Soy Chicken Salad (paraphrased) — if we didn’t tell you it was soy, you would never know. We have a confession to make — they were 100% right. It was so good, we took a pound of it back home for a later snack. I’ll drop another confession: along with the garlic and olive bread we picked up, this quantity did not last beyond lunchtime.</p>

        <p>This should have come out sooner. But I’m sure you will all forgive me, because…well each of you will have a different reason so I’m not going to get into that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.naihar.com/" target="_blank">Naihar</a> is pleased to welcome it’s newest contributor and the UK’s real princess, <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5Aqfneoo1aXT" target="_blank">Dee Rawat</a>. Like I said, this post has come in a little late, so Dee’s already got a head start with two solid posts: her homemade??<a href="http://www.naihar.com/mango-cheesecake-i-just-couldnt-resist-the-te" target="_blank">Mango Cheesecake</a>??(yum!) and a <a href="http://www.naihar.com/bukhara-of-samelsbury" target="_blank">review of Bukhara of Samelsbury</a>??(okay seriously, that cheesecake really looks delicious! Go ahead, click on the link already.). I’m told she also had a fair share to do with the large number of hits the <a href="http://www.naihar.com/bite-sized-demonstration-strawberry-delights" target="_blank">Strawberry bite-size delights post</a> received (including comments from the chef’s themselves).</p>
<p>With successes like these, she requires no introduction. But I thought I should give her one anyway. Welcome aboard!</p>
<p>I’d be amiss (read: dead) if I didn’t mention our other amazing contributors that continue to provide us with finger-licking content and the resulting army of views — a big thanks to <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5fj0bXua0irL" target="_blank">Neelofer</a>, <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5fiRbom5LZYd" target="_blank">Devina</a> &amp; <a href="http://posterous.com/people/5fiYSt6aZLG1" target="_blank">Nikita</a>.

<p>To begin with, this post is dedicated to a certain reader of the blog who, when asked for suggestions for improvement, complained that all our reviews are way to positive. Well, here we are, you pessimistic person you, our first negative review.</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>At the behest of a close friend who had also never tried the place, my first lunch in Philadelphia after three years was at a place creatively called Currito Burrito, right on the??<a href="http://www.drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a>??campus by the residence halls. This was housed in a new food court structure that had come up after I left the city. Oh, the excitement.</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>Curbing my natural instincts to go to Subway — primarily because Subway in the US kicks Subway in the UAE’s behind by a mile and a half — I went for the “new Burrito place that is really good.”</p>
<p>Some considerations later, I went for what they called a Mediterranean Burrito, comprising rice, a Black Bean hummus and some other condiments. I wasn’t overtly impressed with the look and feel, or the way he was actually making my burrito at all. And the burrito, right, let me say it was the worst burrito I’ve had, and that graciously includes??<a href="http://www.naihar.com/black-bean-burritos" target="_blank">my own home-made version</a>.??</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>I don’t really know what else to say except to avoid the place, and particularly the Mediterranean option. The burrito was dry, the rice was…is stuffy an appropriate word? And the flavors just did not work.</p>
<p>??</p>

<p>Father’s Day celebrations found me at a family favourite one Sunday evening. <a href="http://www.bukharasamlesbury.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bukhara</a> in Samlesbury is commonly known as having ‘authentic’ Indian cuisine, though I have never figured out if the attributes of being ‘authentic’ referred to the chefs being south Asian, or the food being truly Indian inspired? Needless to say, we all have our favourites, and this is particularly busy haunt for the Asian communities in the North West.</p>
<p>For starters we ordered a meat feast of mixed grill, which consisted of lamb and chicken kebabs, tandoori chicken, lamb chops. This was accompanied by one of their signature dishes and a particular favourite of mine, as I have made it many a time at home, Thai mango salad. This salad is not as authentically Indian as it is Thai, but nonetheless a great accompaniment to the starters. The salad consisted of a carrots, peppers, onions and mangoes topped of with coriander, and a honey mustard dressing with red chili and pepper.</p>
<p>For mains we ordered Akbari chicken Masala which was extra hot, far too hot for my liking, but my father loved it; and Lahori ghost which was delicious, the lamb was perfectly cooked and the spices perfectly chosen to compliment this dish. the balance was just right. This was all served with fresh nan bread which was soft and brushed with butter. The new desserts menu was the highlight of my evening, I opted for the Apple tarte, another special on the menu, however it was a big letdown, as fussy me could tell that the apples were pre-prepared and had gone slightly brown. The family ordered traditional Indian falooda (a milk based dessert, with sago, rose water, and dumplings of kulfi ice cream inside it), the chocolate waffle meltdown which was amazing and probably one of the best things on the menu, and a mint parfait which was as standard as prepackaged ice cream desserts can get. The biggest fail on the menu I felt was the lack of locally sourced produce, mainly in the form of Huntley’s Ice cream, whose farm is a mere 1 mile up the road.</p>
<p>The ambiance was great, with a family oriented atmosphere, to a restaurant which is always busy and very lively of a weekend. If you’re in the North West of England, why not try this countryside gem, nestled in between dairy and sheep farms midway between Preston and Blackburn. It promises to be a find, and will not disappoint.</p>

<p>The awesome people at <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">Seesmic</a> finally got around to launching their <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone application</a> last week.</p>
<p>I’ve been a fan of Seesmic from rather early days. To me, they edged out <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a> as the Desktop Twitter client to have at the time, having launched support for multiple accounts and integrating <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> support before anyone else did. Since then I’ve moved on to <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">Seesmic Web</a>(I’d recommend it any day considering it doesn’t use Adobe AIR. But I digress…)</p>
<p>I’ll leave the app comparison for another day, but I think Seesmic’s <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone app</a>’s first rendition is quite good overall.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about the app was the seemingly blazing response time, both in terms of loading new information and response using the touchscreen. By this I mean that a lot of apps I use (I’m not talking just Twitter apps) are effectively hung until their update/reload is complete — this does not seem to be the case here. While I wait for the latest tweets to be updated, I can still navigate around the app freely.</p>
<p>Let’s talk unique features. First up is the panel view. This is a fairly neat way of using one app to encompass multiple services. The panels are cleanly organized and easy to navigate. You can even setup a panel for a specific twitter search you follow, making it accessible with one click or swirl. You can navigate between panels by either using the panel button or merely side-swapping them. I thought it was cool that when you are looking at the panel, the faded screenshot is an actual live version of the feed on that panel.</p>
<p>Currently, Seesmic’s app allows you to quickly sign in to your <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.ping.fm/" target="_blank">Ping.fm</a> accounts. Sure there is a facebook app, but from a “feed” point of view, Seesmic does a good job. I will not be surprised to hear additional services being integrated, least of all <a href="http://www.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, which Seesmic recently incorporated into their Web client. Seesmic also integrates with Evernote, allowing you to send tweets directly to <a href="https://www.evernote.com/Login.action?targetUrl=/Home.action" target="_blank">Evernote</a> (in addition to e-mailing them) if you want to save them. Seesmic also has a separate ReTweet tab in the main window, allowing you to view all twitter-style RTs in your timeline as a separate feed.</p>
<p>In comparison to other clients I’ve used though, I see a few lacking features.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d have thought that it would have the ability for app sync, at least with Seesmic’s Web client &amp;mdash for unread tweets, messages and the like. Seesmic’s app is also missing the conversation view, which is bizarre considering this is a standard feature on other apps and Seesmic themselves introduced this on their Web client. It is almost infuriating if you’re trying to track back on a conversation if you have to keep tapping the ‘in reply to’ button to see each tweet. This should have been covered from the get-go.</p>
<p>I also miss having unread counts. This is probably more or less a luxury feature, but I think we as a crowd are just used to having that. I’m perfectly okay with not knowing this for the regular feed, but not having this for @-replies and DMs is unnerving. They also did not include in-line previews (which adds clicks, not desirable on a phone app).</p>
<p>Having said that, I’m quite happy with their first version. I can’t be impressed enough with the speed of the app, and for a first run, they’ve done a good job. In my history with <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">Seesmic</a>, I find that they listen to their users and are quite dynamic in terms of releasing new features, so I expect the same to carry over to their iPhone app. If that happens, don’t be surprised if Seesmic’s <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone app</a> becomes the go-to app for aggregating social networking, beyond just <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">twitter</a>.</p>

        <p>Guilty pleasures are a must for all. Mine is the humble cheesecake.??Whether it is shop bought or home made is always a sticking point for me. The love and care??I put into making cheesecakes at home, is what makes the end result worth the time I painstakingly spend in the kitchen. Here is a little something??I rumbled up today, with some Indian Alphonso mangoes, and??all the other everyday ingredients I found in my fridge or larder cupboard at home.

<p>A late night decision while skimming through a recipe got our family interested in making graduation cupcakes for the sibling marking his entry into the working world. Recession be damned, these chocolate goodys are topped with a nice slice of After Eight, and twizzlers matching the school colors.</p>
<p>(We went with ready cupcakes and toppings, but at least they do look like the convocation cap :P)</p>

<p>What is Mohampar, you ask?</p>
<p>The best description I found for Mohanthal is gram-flour fudge. A traditional Gujarati sweet, Mohanthal is a soft, melt-in-your-mouth type of delicacy, very popular during certain Gujarati festivals like Navratri. This recipe is another??<a href="http://www.naihar.com" target="_blank">naihar</a> specialty, made and distributed to perfection.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2010/06/03/why-is-there.html">Why is there such little professionalism around here?</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Picture the scene. Your big corporate meeting, people flying down from Europe for a day. Let’s all meet they said. We insist we have everyone. Schedule for late Thursday afternoon? Super.</p>
<p>I coordinate with a local contact to attend. Oh, I can’t make it, I have to pick up my kids Thursday afternoon. Right. How about a different time? Yea, that’s fine.</p>
<p>My battery proceeded to die in the evening. So he called me, and I missed it. Around 10 p.m., when I got around to checking e-mail, I see a “I was expecting a call from you.” There was another e-mail regarding a project our companies were partnering on. I had an issue with it, and it was urgent, so I replied questioning his e-mail.</p>
<p>His response five minutes later: “I did not hear back from you regarding the meeting.” I replied I did not get a confirmation so I will get back to him on that in morning. And well, you didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p>I message him after the meeting was confirmed in the morning. He proceeds to call me and say “This is why I was trying to call you yesterday. I can’t make the new time” Eh, what now?!</p>
<p>Fine, you can’t make it. But what am I supposed to figure out when you say I didn’t hear back from you on the meeting. Instead of typing that, why didn’t you type that you couldn’t make the time. Instead of typing “waiting for your call”, couldn’t you have bloody told me what the problem was so when I did check it, I could react?</p>
<p>Let me add that 15 minutes after the scheduled time, he called me. When I returned the call, he told me he wanted to know how the meeting had gone. Er. Did you not propose the time that you then cancelled? You *knew* I’d be in the meeting because it was on your damned calendar as well.</p>
<p>And we wonder why we don’t get a lot of stuff done here. Even though I’m on topic, I will not <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/why-you-shouldnt-bother-with-etisalat" target="_blank">discuss our favorite telco provider</a> today. But seriously, what is it with simple professionalism around these parts. Why is it so painfully lacking. Inform people what to do, what you want. Communicate! Telling me I’m being transparent with you doesn’t make you that, by the way.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t leaving out the country for two weeks, I’m fairly certain another post on customer service would be on its way. Until then, make do with this happy excerpt I received the other day:</p>
<blockquote>Japanese attitude for work:</blockquote>
<blockquote>If someone can do it, you can do it too :)<br />If no one can do it, you must do it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Arabic version:</blockquote>
<blockquote>If someone can do it, let him do it!<br />If no one can do it, why should I do it?</blockquote>
<p>And yes, this was forwarded quite graciously by an Arab.</p>

        <p>Living by yourself during your University days are a great way to bring out the hidden cook in you. Searching for simple, effective recipes for one can be a fun challenge, especially when you try to emulate something you see in a restaurant or cafe.</p>
<p>Presenting a sample of the good ol’ days, if we can call them that, the Black bean burrito. I really didn’t want to leave the house this morning, and I managed to find black beans, mushrooms, onions, some greens, oat wraps and this is very important ??? <a href="http://frico-corporate.nl/frico-products/speciality-cheeses/edam-specialities/red-hot-dutch.htm?steID=2&amp;itmID=322" target="_blank">cheese</a> ??? so I set to work.</p>
<p>Witness the end results taken with my phone camera. And yes, that’s <a href="http://www.whittard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Whittard</a>’s <a href="http://www.naihar.com/i-succumbed-to-the-whittard-temptation" target="_blank">Mango &amp; Passionfruit Iced tea</a> gleaming by the side. Yes, iced tea can gleam, thank you very much.</p>

<p>If you’ve been following this blog (you have, haven’t you? Fine, say that you have?), you’ll know I’m a sucker for iced tea. So after having iced tea a few times at <a href="http://www.whittard.co.uk/" target="_blank">Whittard of Chelsea</a> at Festival City in Dubai, I finally succumbed and picked up this little wonder.</p>
<p>Ah, Whittard’s iced tea from the comfort of my own home.??</p>

<p>After looking at the mouth-watering Mango and curried chick pea salad captured in Chirag’s <a href="http://www.naihar.com/mango-and-curried-chickpea-salad" target="_blank">post</a>, I decided to try my hand at it. So with the help of my mom, I marched into the kitchen with laptop displaying the recipe. <br /> What happened next was a blur of cumin seeds, coriander, mangoes, chickpeas, mom telling me (okay okay, screaming) for almost breaking the mini-blender (I WAS EXCITED, OKAY? Hmph) and spinach leaves. And the end result as you can see is the pic! I have to give credit to my mom. She did most of it…I only stirred in the spices, onion and squeezed out the lemon.</p>
<p>P.S. Not the greatest pic but yea…</p>
