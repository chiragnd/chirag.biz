<blockquote>The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the death sentence awarded to four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gangrape case by a Delhi fast-track court in 2013 and subsequently the Delhi High Court in 2014, rejecting the appeal filed by the convicts.</blockquote>
<p>That we have to cheer that at 4 years and 4 months, this was a ‘fast track’ trial resolution is not a great testament of our due process.</p>
<p>Some things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jyoti Singh, the 23-year-old victim, lost her life on 29 Dec 2012 after immense suffering. Nothing can bring that back.</li>
<li>The accused were given the death penalty as far back as September 2013. The High Court (in March 2014) &amp; The Supreme Court rejected the appeals and upheld the death sentences.</li>
<li>The main accused – who inserted a rusted iron rod into the victim, and gutted her intestines – was judged as a juvenile, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Nirbhaya-juvenile-to-walk-free-on-Dec-20-Centre-opposes-move/articleshow/50179656.cms" target="_blank">released in December 2015 and given a grant of Rs. 10,000 and a sewing machine</a>. He <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PTI_News/status/860521590806781952" target="_blank">currently lives under an assumed name</a>.</li>
<li>The Juvenile Justice Act has since been amended in 2015 such that the age to try juveniles as adults if they commit heinous crimes was lowered to 16.</li>

<p>This post performs a quick dive into the technology-based and process-based security provisions of Aadhaar data.</p>

<hr />

<h3>
<code>Data </code>Access</h3>
<p>The core Aadhaar infrastructure is called the Central Information Data Repository (CIDR). There are two main purposes for which data is accessed from the CIDR: Authentication &amp; e-KYC.</p>
<p><em>For an explanation on the different entities and their relationships within the Aadhaar ecosystem, please see </em><a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-definitions-entities-5adc587c7e38#a8d3" target="_blank"><em>our section on Aadhaar entities</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>A vendor can use Aadhaar authentication to verify you before offering services. This process utilizes your Aadhaar number and either your OTP or biometrics as a second factor to authenticate you. Vendors who use Aadhaar authentication services are authorized by the UIDAI as Authorized User Agencies (AUAs). Each AUA must use an Authorized Service Agency (ASA) — the only entities allowed to connect to the CIDR. The authentication process is explained in more detail <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-definitions-entities-5adc587c7e38#4e42" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In response, the CIDR returns a digitally signed ‘Yes/No’ depending on the success of the authentication request.</p>
<h4>Electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC)</h4>
<p>A vendor can use Aadhaar for the purpose of instant electronic KYC. Just like authentication entities, e-KYC entities must be authorized by the UIDAI, and utilize KSAs (ASAs with KYC permissions) — the only entities allowed to use the e-KYC connection endpoints.</p>
<p>In response, the CIDR returns a digitally signed and encrypted demographic record (name, gender, address, etc) and photograph block¹. In January 2018, a ‘limited KYC’ was introduced where only need-based details would be shared with the authorised agencies.</p>
<h4>APIs</h4>
<p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the industry-standard method to connect to systems. They allow the issuing entity (in this case, the UIDAI) to maintain control over what information — and in what manner — is shared with the requestor. APIs adds a layer of encapsulation by limiting what is available to the ‘outside’ via targeted requests, thus not requiring any direct access to a data store or database (DB).</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you wish to know how many steps I’ve walked on a day, which I log in a DB. Rather than give you direct access to my DB—which also contains other data which you don’t require, nor do I want to share—I give you an API request endpoint, validated by a key:</p>
<pre>[me.example/getSteps](https://me.example/getSteps?authKey=45aedlfkja359874425)</pre>
<p>which returns:</p>
<pre>{ “steps”: 372 } </pre>
<p>Similarly, the Aadhaar authentication service is done over a URL endpoint²:</p>
<pre>https://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;AUA code&gt;/&lt;uid digit 0&gt;/&lt;uid digit 1&gt;/&lt;ASA license key&gt;</pre>
<p>A separate API is used for eKYC or enrolment. The production server hosts are only shared with the ASAs and are not available online. As such, the API endpoints are not accessible over the internet.</p>
<p>The request format for an authentication request is as follows³:</p>
<pre>&lt;Auth uid=”” rc=”” tid=”” ac=”” sa=”” ver=”” txn=”” lk=””&gt; <br />&lt;Uses pi=”” pa=”” pfa=”” bio=”” bt=”” pin=”” otp=””/&gt; <br />&lt;Meta udc=”” rdsId=”” rdsVer=”” dpId=”” dc=”” mi=”” mc=”” /&gt; <br />&lt;Skey ci=””&gt;encrypted and encoded session key&lt;/Skey&gt; <br />&lt;Hmac&gt;SHA-256 Hash of Pid block, encrypted and then encoded&lt;/Hmac&gt; &lt;Data type=”X|P”&gt;encrypted PID block&lt;/Data&gt; <br />&lt;Signature&gt;Digital signature of AUA&lt;/Signature&gt; &lt;/Auth&gt;</pre>
<p>The request only shares meta-data comprising the device information, AUA signature, etc. and the encrypted PID block. Information such as details of the service being provided, or any details about the holder do not form part of the request. Even if a service provider were to pass such information — and it would be illegal to do so — the only blocks and variables recognized by the CIDR are the ones in the above request.</p>
<h4>PID Block</h4>
<p>When a registered device is called by the application, it captures, processes and encodes the digitally signed biometric record⁴.</p>
<pre>Bh=SHA-256(bio_record) <br />Be=DSA(Bh+timestamp+unique_device_code,device_private_key)</pre>
<p>This is used to finally create the signed &amp; encoded biometric record:</p>
<pre>Bs=base64(Be)</pre>
<p>A Device Info Hash (dih) is also included as part of the PID block:</p>
<pre>dih = SHA-256(device_provider_id+device_service_id+device_version+unique_device_code+model_id+idHash)</pre>
<p>The <code>idHash</code> is an encrypted device ID which must match the hash shared with the CIDR when the device was registered. A separate <code>wadh</code> (wrapper API data hash) is also used for eKYC transactions.</p>
<p>In this way, the PID block is created and encrypted on the registered device itself and the process is independent of the AUA application. The biometric record is encrypted using a 256-bit symmetric encryption session key (AES/GCM/No padding). The one-time use session key is then encrypted asymmetrically (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding) with a 2048-bit UIDAI-issued public key, making the CIDR the sole entity that can decrypt the record.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Once created, the PID block is then signed with the AUAs digital key and passed to the ASA. The ASA then makes the API call, along with its own unique digital identifiers and a success or failure response is returned.</p>
<p>Each device must be registered with the UIDAI along with the device provider’s ID, a unique identifier (serial number), a digitally signed certificate, along with the provider’s key issued by the UIDAI⁵. All of these details are part of the meta-data of the authentication or eKYC request.</p>
<p>Currently, the UIDAI is in process to increase the CIDR’s authentication capacity to 10 crore transactions per day⁶.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>To recap, your fingerprint and/or eye scan data are classified as core biometric information and has a one-way ticket into the CIDR. By law, core biometric information collected shall not be shared “with anyone for any reason whatsoever”⁷.</p>
<p>As highlighted in the <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-definitions-entities-5adc587c7e38#8ab4" target="_blank">previous post</a>, the CIDR is classified as a Protected System under the IT Act, 2000, a Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) by the NCIIPC and the UIDAI itself is ISO27001:2013 certified.</p>
<p>The following are some of the security enforcements across the Aadhaar ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no connection endpoint that returns a holder’s biometrics, as required by law⁸.</li>
<li>Demographic information and biometric information are partitioned into separate databases secured between firewalls; a single database does not have all the user’s data in one physical location⁹. Raw biometric data is stored in encrypted form within the CIDR.</li>
<li>Connection to the CIDR is only available to ASAs (27 entities at this time) over 1-to-1 leased line or MPLS¹⁰ links, i.e., not over the internet.</li>
<li>Each ASA is allotted a separate DMZ¹¹.</li>
<li>The PID block is encrypted with AES-256 using a one-time session key. The session key is then encrypted with a 2048-bit UIDAI issued key. This makes it extremely expensive to break¹².</li>
<li>The PID block includes a timestamp and a one-time session key to prevent reuse.</li>
<li>The digital keys of the registered device, the AUA and the ASA are logged and validated for every transaction.</li>
<li>The session key used for the PID block must not be stored and should not be reused across transactions¹³.</li>
<li>GCM encryption¹⁴ was added in API v2.0</li>
<li>Network connectivity between the ASA and AUA must be secured via a leased line or at least a VPN/SSL. It is the ASA’s responsibility to ensure this connectivity requirement.</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication (using Aadhaar number + biometrics + OTP) is also available over the API. This is not mandatory as a phone number is not required for Aadhaar enrolment.</li>
<li>In cases where self-service is not possible and operator interference is required to operate a device, the operator must be authenticated and their Aadhaar number logged to perform any functions.</li>
<li>ASA and registered devices do not store PIB blocks beyond a few seconds in cache for buffering. Device applications and ASAs are verified by the UIDAI directly.</li>
<li>Enrolment client software is entirely written, maintained and provided directly by the UIDAI.</li>
<li>All meta-data of a request — timestamp, the entities involved — are made available online for 6 months, and archived for 7 years by law¹⁵.</li>
<li>The CIDR in its entirety is located inside India and all authentication requests route within the Country.</li>
<li>The Aadhaar number itself is random and is not based on any identifying personal factors of the holder¹⁶.</li>
<li>In January 2018, the UIDAI provides the option to generate a further randomized 16-digit Virtual ID for authentication requests so that users do not need to share their Aadhaar ID with providers. There are no limit to generating new Virtual IDs for the same Aadhaar, the old one is automatically discontinued once a new ID is generated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[1] Aadhaar does not independently verify addresses submitted as part of enrollment. However, it should be noted that Aadhaar only accepts otherwise verifiable proof of address (such as a passport, electricity bill, water bill within 3 months old, bank statement, etc).</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Aadhaar was established as a national Unique Identification number (UID) system. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) falls under the purview of the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY), and is audited by the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General (CAG).</p>
<p>This post attempts to review Aadhaar as the verifiable identification and authentication system in India based on a review of relevant provisions within the Aadhaar Act, 2016 and its Regulations.</p>
<p>The next post <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/understanding-aadhaar-data-security-85d361d47f72" target="_blank">covers data security</a>.</p>

<h3>Authentication &amp; Working</h3>
<p>Authentication — the ability to know that you are who you say you are before giving you access to something — is a fundamental tenet in information security. Credibility is infinitely improved when an authorized service provider can genuinely validate you, compared to receiving a photocopy of your passport. In return, you are guaranteed no one else is receiving a service or benefit to which you are entitled.</p>
<p>With this understanding, we explore the Aadhaar concept — a one-way authentication service. A service provider can authenticate you on a) your Aadhaar number and b) either OTP or biometrics, and deliver a service or a subsidy to you. The Aadhaar network does not communicate out of turn with the service provider though, and is not aware of what service was provided to you<a href="#df6d">¹</a>. It only knows which service provider requested your authentication, and logs this for audit purposes.²</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/6b158-1pns2lsaaxdn7o7n3ds9vfa.png" />

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">All Aadhaar authentication is initiated by the user via the relevant agency.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To use a specific example, here’s what a headline like ‘mobile phones will now be linked to Aadhaar’ means: instead of storing photocopies of your driver’s license or passport, the telecom provider (via an authorized service agency, explained below) requests authentication using Aadhaar, and upon receiving a ‘Yes’ issues you a SIM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aadhaar logs when the telecom provider asked for your authentication, that it was successful</li>
<li>The service agency logs the same details but does not save (by law) any other data</li>
<li>The telecom provider logs the request and the result, and services that were delivered. It does not see any other data used for authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>This concept is similar to credit card payments, where the service provider requests to charge you via a payment gateway. The gateway collects &amp; transmits your card details to the issuing bank, both of which only aware of the provider and the total charge. The service provider also does not see your credit card number.</p>
<h4>Aadhaar data</h4>
<p>Aadhaar’s core data infrastructure is called The Central Information Data Repository (CIDR). No details regarding its location or type of systems is available.</p>
<p>The CIDR is classified as a Protected System³ under the IT Act, 2000, a Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) by the NCIIPC⁴ and the UIDAI itself is ISO27001:2013 certified⁵.</p>
<p>Key facts regarding the data stored within the CIDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name, date of birth, address, gender, and (optional) mobile/email constitute <em>demographic information</em>.</li>
<li>Race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of entitlement (benefits/subsidies), income or medical history are excluded by law.⁶</li>
<li>Photograph, fingerprints &amp;/or iris scan constitute <em>biometric information</em>.</li>
<li>Of this, fingerprints &amp; eye scan data are <em>core biometric data</em>, and excluded by law from being shared with “anyone for any reason whatsoever”.⁷ ⁸</li>
<li>Biometric data is also ‘sensitive personal data or information’ status per IT Act, 2000.⁹</li>
<li>Demographic information and biometric information are partitioned into separate databases. A single database does not have all of a holder’s information.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Government to request anyone’s Aadhaar logs within the CIDR, it must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the “interest of national security”</li>
<li>directed by an officer with minimum rank of Joint Secretary</li>
<li>reviewed by an Oversight Committee consisting of 1 Cabinet Secretary and secretaries of the Department of Legal affairs &amp; the Department of Electronics &amp; Information Technology.¹⁰</li>
<li>pursuant to an order of a court not lower than a District Judge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an order is valid for a period of 3 months, with a possible 3 month extension which must be reviewed by the Oversight Committee.</p>
<h4>De-duplication¹¹</h4>
<p>During enrollment, an applicant’s data is validated against the CIDR to ensure that the holder was not previously issued an Aadhaar number, a process known as de-duplication.</p>
<p>Aadhaar de-duplication is mandated by Regulation and is performed using 3 different biometric algorithm softwares.¹²</p>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>The penalty clauses under the Aadhaar Act provides for¹³:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 3-year term and/or a fine of Rs. 10,000 for impersonation, an attempt to impersonate during enrollment or to change identity information</li>
<li>A 3-year term and/or Rs. 10,000 fine for individuals and Rs. 1,00,000 for companies for unauthorized collection of identity information, intentionally disclosing, transmitting, copying of information</li>
<li>A 3-year term and a minimum fine of Rs. 10,00,000 for unauthorized access or attempt to access, download or any play with data within the CIDR</li>
<li>For companies, each person in charge of, or responsible to the company are also considered guilty unless they can prove otherwise.</li>
<li>All penalties apply over and above any other penalties charged (such as under the IT Act, 2000 or the Indian Penal Code)</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<h4>Biometric Lock</h4>
<p>An Aadhaar holder can place a permanent lock on biometric data after which it cannot be used for authentication. This lock can be temporarily removed ahead of a legitimate authentication request, and is automatically locked again once the request is completed or after a specific time, whichever is earlier.¹⁴ When locked, an authentication request results in a ‘No’ response.</p>
<h4>Virtual ID</h4>
<p>You can generate a 16-digit randomized Virtual ID to be used for authentication requests instead of your Aadhaar ID. This allows you to mask your original Aadhaar from the provider while still using it for identification. All providers must accept Virtual IDs for services by June 2018.</p>
<h4>Consent</h4>
<p>The Aadhaar Act mandates that consent of the holder must be taken and recorded for enrollment or an authentication request. The holder must be also be informed about the purpose for which authentication is being requested. Failure to do so is a violation of the Act and can be penalized.¹⁵</p>
<hr />

<h3>Entities</h3>
<p>There are three types of entities which share a technology relationship with the CIDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication Service Agency (ASA), 27: Entities with established 1-to-1 secure leased line/MPLS connectivity with the CIDR, regulated directly by the UIDAI to provide authentication services.</li>
<li>Authentication User Agency (AUA), 350: Entities that provide services based on Aadhaar-based authentication performed by a registered ASA¹⁶.</li>
<li>Electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC), 271: Entities that perform KYC using Aadhaar. e-KYC, upon successful authentication, receive a digitally signed response containing encrypted demographic information and photograph for instant, non-repudiable KYC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current live list of Aadhaar entities is <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/images/list_of_live_asa_aua_ksa_kua.pdf" target="_blank">available here</a>, and seems to be updated once a month. Holders are encouraged to ensure they are providing consent to entities on this list alone.</p>
<p>A full breakdown of the ASA-AUA ecosystem, along with the framework to transmit data, is forthcoming.</p>
<h3>Aadhaar Act, 2016</h3>
<p>The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits &amp; Services) Act, 2016 provides legislative backing to Aadhaar as the national unique identification mechanism in the Country¹⁷. The Act superceeds the <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/images/bill_for_national_identification_authority_of_india_13012017.pdf" target="_blank">The Bill for National Identification Authority of India, 2010</a>.</p>
<p>The Aadhaar Act 2016 also provides clear definitions and processes for enrolment, core biometric data specifications, authentication, audits, overall protection of information and the responsibilities of the UIDAI.</p>
<p>As of the writing of this post, Aadhaar cards for non-residents and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) holders is still in the works. No timeframe for this is yet available¹⁸.</p>
<h4>Alternative ID</h4>
<p>A person who does not have an Aadhaar card but is entitled to any benefit paid from the Consolidated Fund of India will not be denied this benefit until his Card is issued, provided an alternative means of identification is made available to the entity in question¹⁹.</p>
<hr />

<p>As of the time of writing this post, 113 crore Aadhaar cards have been issued, and the last five years have witnessed over 400 crore authentication transactions²⁰.</p>
<p>Caution when it pertains to data privacy is both desirable and needed. Aadhaar is an ambitious program that seeks to provide a unified, unique, non-repudiable and verifiable form of identity to millions at a near incomparable scale. The world is taking clear notice of this development. As <a href="https://medium.com/u/d22fa00ce21f" target="_blank">Vivek Wadhwa</a>— distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University — highlights, <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/vivek-wadhwa-america-has-much-to-learn-from-india-aadhaar-a-game-changer-3bda809f00a9?source=---------2" target="_blank">India is pioneering something the West can learn from</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The instant and non-repudiable proof of identity that Aadhaar’s know your customer technology, e-KYC, provides, gives India a big advantage. Most people in the US have drivers licenses and social security numbers. But these are not verifiable with biometrics or mobile numbers, so complex verification technologies need to be built into every financial system. Indian entrepreneurs building applications don’t need to worry about all this.</blockquote>
<p>Beyond entrepreneurs, the fact that schemes or benefits can be rolled out by governments (both Centre and states) without the need to build separate complex infrastructures which then witness on-boarding delays clearly have numerous benefits.</p>
<p>Some of this is already visible, with <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-data-base-fully-safe-and-secure-says-uidai/story-rMkGys9n1UMnzyKO04BAeM.html" target="_blank">Government estimates of Rs. 50,000 crore leakages being plugged so far</a>. The system has helped root out ‘ghosts’ within the system as well, where <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/87-lakh-mnrega-job-cards-removed-54bad536316d?source=---------0" target="_blank">87 lakh unknown MNREGA job cards were removed</a> or that <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/4-4-lakh-ghost-students-in-jharkhand-manipur-andhra-pradesh-bf50600d3564?source=---------0" target="_blank">4.4 lakh students in just 3 states only existed on paper</a>.</p>
<p>That said, we must look at the law and the implementation ecosystem to determine whether enough has been done to ensure security, and alleviate privacy concerns of the citizens who will need to subscribe to the national ID.</p>
<p>Legally, The Aadhaar Act, 2016 and expansive Regulations for Enrolment, Authentication, Data Security &amp; Sharing of Information, are serious attempts to tighten legislation and processes related to Aadhaar usage. A first-glance comparison indicates that the 2016 Act is a far cry away — particularly in terms of handling of biometric data, and privacy — from the Bill that was tabled in 2010. For example, under the 2010 Bill, sharing biometric data outside the CIDR would have been perfectly legal.</p>
<p>In some (perhaps, many) ways, the attention and eyeballs on Aadhaar is a good thing, where even the smallest flaw would put the credibility of Aadhaar at stake, and should keep the men and women behind Aadhaar on their toes, as they should be.</p>
<hr />

<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<ul>
<li>What happens to Aadhaar data upon death? While logs and data itself should be maintained pursuant to legal requirements, a straightforward way to permanently lock (with no option for temporary unlock thereafter) a deceased person’s biometric data should be made available.</li>
<li>There is ample protection under law for violation by any entity — authorized or unauthorized — that performs unauthorized actions within the Aadhaar framework. No statistics around timeframe to resolving grievances is available at the moment. Beyond grievance redressal, should a special Court or Tribunal be instituted specifically for Aadhaar?</li>
<li>It makes logistical sense that that UIDAI has engaged with enrollment agencies to help with Aadhaar dispensation. Now that enrolment has crossed 95%, should the UIDAI consolidate the enrolment ecosystem and annex it within direct control of the UIDAI?</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h4>Grievance Redressal</h4>
<p>As of today, online grievances may be submitted via the <a href="http://pgportal.gov.in/GrievanceNew.aspx" target="_blank">Centralized Public Grievance Redressal System</a>.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/midday-meal-scheme-aadhaar-exposes-4-4-lakh-ghost-students-across-3-states/story-9Kna9AHXQYX59bn4bzvrzO.html" target="_blank">Moushumi Das Gupta and Neelam Pandey, reporting for Hindustan Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The 12-digit Aadhaar number has helped states strike off 4.4 lakh “ghost students” from schools across Jharkhand, Manipur and Andhra Pradesh, for whom the government had been earmarking funds under the mid-day meal scheme.</blockquote>
<p>This is no small number. Those raising a large hue and cry over the Government’s decision to introduce Aadhaar verification of students availing the benefit need to understand the numbers, and the leak at stake.</p>
<blockquote>For instance, Andhra Pradesh — which linked all its 29 lakh government school students to Aadhaar — had 2.1 lakh claimants who existed only on paper.</blockquote>
<p>It might look small at 7.2% but remember that’s 2,10,000 fake students. And this is just one state.</p>
<blockquote>In Jharkhand, the names of 2.2 lakh non-existent students have been deleted from school records. So far, 89% of the 48 lakh students enrolled in the state’s government schools have availed of Aadhaar numbers.</blockquote>
<p>4.4 lakh fake students in just 3 states implies a large leak within the mid-day meal scheme, especially since the way the process works is that a state government receives a contribution from the Centre (Northeastern states receive 90% from the Centre, all other states get 40%) against the number of students receiving the subsidy. In 2015–16, 10.3 crore students availed the subsidy. Even at 7%, the number of ghost students could be 72,00,000!</p>
<p>The cost incurred by the Central Government is Rs. 4.13 per child per day for primary and Rs. 6.18 per child per day for upper primary. Even at the Rs. 4.13 cost level, we’re looking at estimated leakages amount to Rs. 1000 crores across the Country, and this does not include spending by the states.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a large leak within the mid-day meal scheme, add to already immense <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-data-base-fully-safe-and-secure-says-uidai/story-rMkGys9n1UMnzyKO04BAeM.html" target="_blank">Rs. 49,000 crore estimated to be saved by controlling leakages in LPG subsidy, MNREGA, scholarship and pension schemes</a>.</p>
<p>This doesn’t even begin on the teacher’s problem:</p>
<blockquote>A pilot study conducted by Kerala’s department of general education in 2014, after Aadhaar numbers were integrated with the student database, found its schools to have an excess of 3,892 teachers.</blockquote>
<hr />

<p>In terms of total numbers:</p>
<blockquote>At present, only 30% of the 11 crore students enrolled in class one to eight at government schools across India possess Aadhaar cards.</blockquote>
<p>Remember that the Government has clarified that it will not deny benefits for lack of Aadhaar, but will continue to encourage larger enrollment to help weed out the problem.</p>

<blockquote>When urea is applied to the soil, it is first hydrolysed or broken by water into ammonium ions (NH4+), followed by oxidation to nitrite (NO2-) and, then, nitrate (NO3-) forms. This nitrification process is what makes the nitrogen, which is 46 per cent in urea, available to the crops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[…]</blockquote>
<blockquote>Neem oil basically acts as a ‘nitrification inhibitor’ when coated on urea. By slowing down urea hydrolysis and nitrification, it allows a more gradual release of nitrogen, which can be used by the plant. “Neem-coating increases nitrogen use efficiency. Also, since the urea action is prolonged, the plants stay greener for a longer time. Farmers apply urea when they notice the leaves turning yellowish. But if the crop here is retaining greenness for an extended period, they would reduce the frequency of application. Instead of three bags for an acre of paddy or wheat, they might be using only two now”, Prasad points out.</blockquote>
<p>Some science behind the ‘magic’ behind neem-coated urea, which might explain the contradiction that although food grain output is rising YoY, fertilizer sales are in fact, down, including that of urea. Good read.</p>

<blockquote>Americans suffering a crisis of confidence about the future of their country’s democratic institutions under President Donald Trump could use a dose of Indian-style optimism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[…]</blockquote>
<blockquote>India’s experience offers a useful antidote to Western pessimism — and a reminder that democracy can offer solutions to the growth and governance dilemmas that afflict the United States and Europe.</blockquote>
<p>Twining takes a view on the ‘feeling’ side of the political debate, crediting Modi with ‘doing something’ with his strong political mandate which, in the context of the thumping victory in Uttar Pradesh, seems to be creating an undercurrent of optimism in India. He highlights FDI reform, overall growth cross 7% per year, the upcoming Goods &amp; Services Tax, bankruptcy bill, demonetisation, Jan-Dhan Accounts and Direct Benefit Transfer, and the Modi Government’s foreign policy.</p>
<p>He also makes an interesting point regarding India’s constant election situation:</p>
<blockquote>At the same time, aspirational Indian voters increasingly manifest a tendency to reward governments that deliver growth and toss out politicians who do not meet performance tests. Strong anti-incumbency instincts keep politicians on their toes.</blockquote>
<p>I think that the cost and constant election cycle are more detrimental than good, but perhaps the corollary to India constantly analysing everything from an election perspective is that politicians also have to be ‘on their toes’.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting take overall, correctly grasping the optimism among Indians since 2014, against the overall pessimism in the US since their last election.</p>

        <p><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-collegium-ends-1-year-impasse-by-finalising-judicial-appointment-procedure/articleshow/57639152.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">Dhananjay Mahapatral, reporting for The Times of India</a>:</p>
<blockquote>…the Supreme Court collegium has finalised the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges to constitutional courts.</blockquote>
<p><em>Finally</em>.</p>
<p>The appointment of Supreme Court judges was a heavily debated topic under previous Chief Justice T. S. Thakur, starting with the Centre’s suggestion for a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), which was <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-strikes-down-njac-revives-collegium-system-of-appointing-judges/" target="_blank">struck down by the Supreme Court in October 2015</a>.</p>
<p>In December 2015, a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the <a href="http://barandbench.com/collegium-supreme-court-leaves-it-to-centre-to-amend-memorandum-gives-suggestions/" target="_blank">Central Government could amend the Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of judges, in consultation with the CJI</a>. The Bench also broadly suggested that amendments towards eligibility of judges, transparency in appointments and establishment of a secretariat to review appointment-related complaints be looked into.</p>
<p>A bone of contention related to the ‘national security’ clause that the Centre insisted on adding to the eligibility of judges for appointment, and the Secretariat. Progress has been swift since Chief Justice J. S. Khehar took over in January, and the new Collegium has now approved both items.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<blockquote>Finalisation of the MoP, which will be sent to the Centre for approval and adoption this week, raises hopes of speedy filling up of vacancies in HCs, which are operating at below 60% of their sanctioned strength.</blockquote>
<p>Clearance of pending cases is a huge problem in India. Just last week, the Supreme Court also set out timelines for case hearing, ordering lower courts to <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/supreme-court-conclude-bail-applications-in-1-week-magisterial-trial-in-6-months-sessions-trial-96193be9c09e" target="_blank">dispense of cases more than five years’ old by the end of the year</a>.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>EVMs have been used in all elections in India since 2000, and began their use in Lok Sabha elections in 2004. Quite naturally, there are a few advantages to the EVMs over the traditional ballot paper usage in India. EVMs are cost-efficient, less prone to booth capture and rigging while also severely reduce polling and counting times. In fact, a Madras High Court judgement from 2005 <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/605347/" target="_blank">estimates cost of printing and counting using ballots to be 30–40% of total election expenses</a>.</p>
<h4>The machines</h4>
<p>An EVM comprises two units — a Ballot Unit and a Control Unit. The program used in EVMs is burnt into a one-time programmable chip so that it cannot be altered with thereafter. The machines are not networked in any way to ensure prevention of external interference. EVMs are powered by a 6V battery, and therefore do not rely on an external power source.</p>
<p>In 2006, newer EVMs were introduced with features such as dynamic coding between Ballot Unit and Control Unit, real-time clock, full display, and data and time stamp of each key press.</p>
<p>The EC has now received approval to introduce an upgrade to the EVM, dubbed the ‘M3’ which <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/all-pre-2006-evms-to-be-replaced-with-new-m3s-7353a8cd2e1c#.cqel52lu0" target="_blank">will replace all pre-2006 EVMs</a> last used during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This would mean that older machines without the date-time stamp and other features introduced in 2006 will no longer be in use. The newer machines also have a digital verification system to oversee the contact between two component units, making it further tamper proof by turning the machine inoperative upon fault or change in components. 5.5 lakh M3 EVMs have already been ordered, costing Rs. 3000 crore.</p>
<p>During the 2017 Assembly elections, as part of a United Nations Development Program initiative, <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/13-representatives-from-election-management-bodies-are-in-new-delhi-to-witness-ongoing-assembly-d318acb50cf9#.d2u9iihg1" target="_blank">5 countries were given briefings on the Indian electoral process</a>, including the use of EVMs and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT).</p>
<h4>Manufacture</h4>
<p>Two indigenous companies currently build the EVMs: Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL), a PSU under Ministry of Defense, and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. (ECIL), a PSU under the Ministry of Atomic Energy.</p>
<p>The EC has <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/all-pre-2006-evms-to-be-replaced-with-new-m3s-7353a8cd2e1c#.cqel52lu0" target="_blank">requested approval for a third — Central Electronics Ltd. — to be added to help with production of newer M3 units</a>, this approval is still pending.</p>
<p>The EC notes that various levels of testing is performed at these sites before any machines are put into production, including independent units that perform Quality Assurance of the machines. Further, manufacturers do not have information about candidates several years into the future, or what constituency or the sequence of candidates in the Ballot Unit.</p>
<h4>Procedure</h4>
<p>Before every election, the EC begins a series of checks¹:</p>
<ul>
<li>A first level check (FLC) is done in the presence of political parties’ representatives. Manufacturers certify all components are original within the operational EVMs (malfunctioning EVMs are not used in the election).</li>
<li>The plastic cabinet of the Control Unit are then sealed, and signed by the parties’ representatives. Access to any internal components does not occur thereafter.</li>
<li>The parties representatives then randomly select 5% of the EVMs, on which a minimum of 1,000 votes are cast. Results of this ‘mock poll’ and all votes are printed and shared with the representatives, and the poll is videographed.</li>
<li>EVMs are randomized once for allocation of machines to constituencies, and a second time to the individual polling stations in the presence of candidates or their representatives. Final list of EVM serial numbers allocated to a polling station are provided to the parties or their candidates.</li>
<li>Candidates and their representatives are allowed to conduct additional mock polls at candidate setting.</li>
<li>They can also conduct a mock poll before the actual poll on poll day.</li>
<li>Once the candidate setting is complete, the Ballot Unit of the EVM is also sealed, preventing access to the inside of the Ballot Unit. This is also signed by the candidate/representatives.</li>
<li>On polling day, a mock poll with a minimum of 50 votes is conducted at each polling station in the presence of representatives.</li>
<li>An additional thread seal and paper seal are now put on the EVMs to block access to all buttons except those needed for the poll. Candidates/representatives are allowed to sign off on this as well.</li>
<li>At the end of polling, the presiding officer presses the ‘close’ button on the EVM in the presence of polling agents. No votes can be polled thereafter.</li>
<li>Now the EVM is sealed entirely, and candidates/representatives are allowed to sign off are they are satisfied.</li>
<li>Strong rooms where EVMs are sealed between polling and counting. Candidates/representatives are allowed to place their own seals, and have their own watchers. The EC posts its own watchers 24x7.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h4>Historically speaking…</h4>
<p>Before and after EVMs were introduced, numerous committees were constituted to review their use. To start of, a technical expert committee was appointed by the GoI in 1990, headed by Prof. S. Sampath, with Prof. P. V. Indiresan, and Dr. C. Rao Kasarbada as members. In November 2010, this Committee was expanded to add two additional experts in Prof. D. K. Sharma and Prof. Rajat Moona (now Director General, C-DAC).</p>
<p>The courts were involved as well. The Madras High Court started by rejecting tampering allegations all the way back in 2001, followed by the Kerala High Court in 2002. In 2004, the Karnataka High Court Judge K S Rai said:</p>
<blockquote>After thorough practical experimentation and research the present version of EVM is designed. This invention is undoubtedly a great achievement in the electronic and computer technology and a national pride.</blockquote>
<p>A Mumbai High Court judgement was also issued in 2005.</p>
<p>In 2010, Hari K. Prasad² along with Alex Halderman and Rop Gonggrijp, published a study wherein they claimed to have proved that Indian EVMs were hackable.</p>
<p>Their paper implies that it is not a ‘hack’ of the original system using a vulnerability in software, they physically replaced one of the components with a look-alike. This look-alike was then remotely instructed to modify votes. Their second option also involved breaking into the machine between polling and counting since there is often a delay between these two events. In either case, some kind of physical access to the device was needed to perform any tampering, meaning their claims were based on procedural issues in delivering and storing EVMs, and physically replacing components. These issues are addressed by the detailed process described above, and further improved by newer digitally-encoded EVMs.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2013, the Supreme Court, on petition by Subramanian Swamy overturning the High Court of Delhi, ruled that the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/supreme-court-india-voter-verifiable-paper-audit-trails-must-be-used" target="_blank">EC needed to add Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system to EVMs</a> as a requirement for free and fair elections, and to add to voter confidence.</p>
<p>20,000 VVPATs were purchased in 2013, and 33,500 came through in 2016. The assembly elections in Goa had all 40 constituencies with VVPAT.</p>
<p>In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, VVPAT was available in 8 constituencies. The announcement of the new M3 machines by the EC is congruent with the Supreme Court verdict towards replacing all old EVMs prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</p>

<p>¹ Based on the process as described by the <a href="http://eci.pib.in" target="_blank">Election Commission of India</a>.</p>
<p>² Hari Prasad was reportedly arrested sometime in 2010. While there is not much additional information, it is believed the reason for his arrest was not his research findings, but the fact that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Man-who-stole-EVM-in-Mumbai-held-in-Hyderabad/articleshow/6398910.cms" target="_blank">he had obtained an EVM and refused to reveal his source</a>, as it did not come from the EC.</p>

<p>Updated (9 Apr 2017) to include additional details regarding new M3 EVMs</p>

        <h4>…and a little bit about Shakti Peeth</h4>
<p>Shakti Peeth, or seat of Shakti, comprise a series of holy destinations originated when Goddess Sati’s body disintegrated into pieces and fell all over the subcontinent when Lord Shiv carried her corpse in sorrow on her death. 51 peeths are recognized around India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Out of this, 12 are considered main Shakti Peeth Tirth, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bhagwati Mahakali Maha Shakti, Ujjan</li>
<li>Mata Kamakshi at Kanchi Puram</li>
<li>Bramaramba, Malaygiri</li>
<li>Kumarika, Kanya Kumari</li>
<li>Ambaji, Gujarat</li>
<li>Mahalaxmi, Kohlapur</li>
<li>Devi Lalita at Prayag</li>
<li>Vindhyavasini, Vindhya</li>
<li>Vishalakshi, Varanasi</li>
<li>Mangalavati, Gaya</li>
<li>Sundari Bhavani, Bengal</li>
<li>Guhyakesari, Nepal</li>
</ul>

<p>Ambājī (અંબાજી, अम्बाजी) is located 185 km from Ahmedabad in Gujarat, and 45 kms from Mount Abu in Rajasthan. It is believed that the Heart of Sati Devi fell here, according to <em>Tantra Chudamani</em>.</p>
<h4>Gabbar</h4>
<p>The location where Devi Sati’s heart fell is Gabbar parvath. Gabbar also assumes significance in two main time periods in our history — during Ramayan, where Lord Ram and Laxman were told to worship Devi Ambaji at Gabbar, where he was given ‘Ajay’ arrow; and the mundan ceremony of child Lord Krishna in presence of his foster parents Nand and Yashoda.</p>
<p>A small temple has been built on Gabbar for darshan. For those who cannot climb to visit Gabbar parvath, a Cable car service is available with a lovely scenic view of one side of the mountain.</p>

<h4>The temple, and the Shakti Yantra</h4>
<p>The Shikhar of the temple is 61 ft high, at the top of which is a Dhwaj (holy long flag) and Mataji’s Trishul.</p>
<p>There is no idol or picture in the main temple. A convex-shaped Holy Shakti Vishwa Yantra, inscribed with figures and 51 Bijapatra (letters) and the ‘Shree’ syllable is installed such that it is visible for devotion, and cannot be photographed. Non-priests are no longer allowed in the core area around the Yantra.</p>
<p>The priests decorate the Shakti Yantra such that one can imagine it as an idol of Ma Amba in one of her incarnations, shown on her vahan. Depending on the day of the week, Devi ma is shown to be on a different vahan between a peacock, lion, elephant, etc. I will hopefully post the exact set the next time I’m able to visit.</p>
<p>About two years ago, a ‘museum’ of sorts has been setup in the temple, where the team shares a bit about the history of the temple and its importance. A replica of the yantra is also available, and it is truly amazing how different the yantra actually is, compared to what you experience in the temple itself.</p>
<p>Ambaji temple is one of the only places in the world where I experience true peace of mind. As a family, we do try to visit the temple at least once a year.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, the temple trust has been using gold donations to the template to encash the shrine in gold. Over 30 kg of gold has been donated so far, to help with the project to to cover the Shikhar, of which 41 ft have been completed.</p>
<p>The internals of the shrine have also been gold encased as of my last visit.</p>
<p>You can donate to the temple through SBI (Gujarat &gt; Religious Institute &gt; Shree Arasuri Ambajimata Devasthan Trust) <a href="https://www.onlinesbi.com/prelogin/institutiontypedisplay.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The temple also has a Havan Shala, with one main Havan Kund and 8 smaller Havan Kund.</p>
<h4>Festivals</h4>

<p>Bhadarva Poonam is one of the most popular festivals for visitors to the temple. An estimated 18 — 20 lakh pedesterian pilgrims visit during the festival. Have witnessed them walking along the path to the temple for days and various pop-up rest stops that serve tea, food and rest to the pilgrims are set up by devotees. The euphoria of devotees is a sight and feeling to behold, as I was fortunate enough to a couple of years ago. Devotees arrive with their dhwaj’s and are allowed to climb to the side of the Shikhar to hoist it.</p>
<h4>51 Shaktipeeth replica</h4>
<p>Lookalike temples of all 51 Shakti Peeth have been created right by Gabbar hills. The project took 6 years to finish and was opened for visit in 2014, allowing devotees to experience all 51 Shakti Peeths in one place.</p>
<h4>Timings</h4>
<p>Ambaji temple timings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning Aarti: 6–6:30 a.m.</li>
<li>Darshan: 6:30–10:45 a.m.</li>

<blockquote>Karthik’s website, “<a href="http://returntoindiakit.com/" target="_blank">Return to India Kit</a>” is a straightforward, no-frills guide, that offers returning Indians advice on everything from how and why to get an Aadhaar card to changing postal addresses from the US to India to settling loose ends with the IRS (the US tax agency) to getting OCI cards for American-born children to finding jobs in India. Along the way, it also has resources on setting up start-ups in India, transferring wealth back to India and so on.</blockquote>
<p>I’ve interacted with Mani a few times on Twitter and once in person during his past Middle-east life. This is a smart, and a lovely initiative. Credible knowledge transfer is something that deserves encouragement.</p>
