      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://www.orfonline.org/expert-speaks/new-trends-in-digital-transactions/" target="_blank">Rupa Subramanya, writing for ORF Online</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The data for PoS show that December 2016 saw a whopping 84 percent increase in PoS as compared to the trend and January 2017 saw a big 72 percent increase above trend. Again, while it’s true there’s a drop in absolute level, such two data point analysis misses the fact that PoS is still way above the pre-demonetisation trend.</blockquote>
<p>This is part of Rupa’s <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/while-digitalisation-has-proceeded-cash-has-not-become-unimportant-44345fc93586" target="_blank">ongoing research into digitisation</a> of the Indian economy overall, including as an effect of demonetization.</p>
<p>As I have also said before, we are still months away from the ‘final’ picture. The general expectation, and the data seems aligned with this, is the net usage pattern, once the dust well and truly settles will be a larger digitisation of the Indian economy by more than just a few percentage points.</p>
<p>Bank transactions such as NEFT, IMPS are seeing double digit percentage increases, the only question to be raised is how much of this is force, and how much of it preference.</p>
<p>She also raises causes for concern:</p>
<blockquote>…admittedly anecdotal evidence suggests that after an initial adoption of digital payments methods, some smaller merchants and traders are now reverting to cash, since the liquidity crunch has largely eased. By the same token, some consumers are now reverting to cash, which is back in ATMs.</blockquote>
<p>Rupa is right in suggesting that this isn’t about trying to return to a ‘black’ economy per se, but issues like “high frequency of failed transactions, network issues and high transaction costs” are certainly making cash feel more convenient. There will also be a more general pushback out of desire to return to old habits now that the ‘inconvenience’ of being forced to use digital payments is over.</p>
<p>BHIM is making good strides to counter this problem (17 million downloads and transactions volumes going up), but digitisation will be well and truly home once banks decide to make it easier to do so. The latest series of bank transacation charges will only put off consumers.</p>
<p>Until then, cash will always feel and be the ‘cheaper’ option.</p>

<p>Hi all, I wanted to introduce <a href="https://ekdrishti.in/talk/home" target="_blank">Drishti talk</a>, our podcast covering informative discourse around topics that matter to the Indian electorate.</p>
<p>To this end, I invite you to please <a href="https://ekdrishti.in" target="_blank">follow our publication here with a Medium account</a> or on <a href="http://twitter.com/ekdrishti" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you prefer. Tell us your topics of interest, or topics you have expertise on and would like a platform to share.</p>
<p>We think there are enough political debates — particularly shouting matches — out there, and our focus is on informing the Indian voter by puttings facts and direction in context and trying to understand real outcomes.</p>
<p>The general format will be free-flowing conversation (30–45 minutes long) that is both constructive and positive around the India story and hopefully sensitive topics that are lacking informative discussion.</p>
<p>You can listen to our podcast using:</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/03/06/the-aadhaar-breach.html">The Aadhaar ‘breach’</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://www.livemint.com/Industry/IKgrYL5pg3eTgfaP253XKI/Aadhaar-data-breach-triggers-privacy-concerns.html" target="_blank">Suranjana Roy, reporting for LiveMint</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The UIDAI filed a police complaint on 15 February against Axis Bank Ltd, business correspondent Suvidhaa Infoserve and e-sign provider eMudhra, alleging they had attempted unauthorized authentication and impersonation by illegally storing Aadhaar biometrics.</blockquote>
<p>In terms of details:</p>
<blockquote>The breach was noticed after one individual performed 397 biometric transactions between 14 July 2016 and 19 February 2017. Of these, 194 transactions were performed through Axis Bank, 112 through eMudhra and 91 through Suvidhaa Infoserve.</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=158849" target="_blank">statement issued by the UIDAI</a>, they said:</p>
<blockquote>With reference to an incident of misuse of biometrics reported in a newspaper, UIDAI said that it is an isolated case of an employee working with a bank’s Business Correspondent’s company making an attempt to misuse his own biometrics which was detected by UIDAI internal security system and subsequently actions under the Aadhaar Act have been initiated.</blockquote>
<p>It looks like an employee working within the Aadhaar framework played with the data (the UIDAI says it was his own data), and that it was UIDAI that flagged the issue and filed a criminal case against the parties involved. In technical terms, the Aadhaar database was not hacked or breached, but human access of the platform was misused. Moreover, it is the important to note that it is the UIDAI’s own systems that eventually picked up on this misuse.</p>
<p>But it does raise some of the larger points the opponents of Aadhaar keep highlighting — trusting any entity with data, particularly biometric data, is unsafe by definition. There is though, the point wherein a unique identity system in a country like India where benefits, subsidies and other services are rampant and untraceable, having a unique, two-step verifiable method to verify citizens’ access to schemes, and rooting out corruption has already brought about <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/direct-benefit-transfer-leads-to-rs-50000-crore-savings-for-government-in-3-years/articleshow/57240387.cms" target="_blank">numerous</a> <a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/what-13-million-fake-cooking-gas-consumers-reveal-88357" target="_blank">benefits</a>.</p>
<p>I’d love to have a more detailed debate on Aadhaar, one covering the Act, the change in its provisions in March 2016, and the larger point of making where to take Aadhaar in India — including how it is administered/delivered, privacy regulations, and more. Please comment if this is something you’d be interested in doing, and we’ll see how we can give this discussion some shape.</p>
<p>One final tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>There has been no incident of misuse of Aadhaar biometrics leading to identity theft and financial loss during the last five years when more than 400 crore Aadhaar authentication transactions have taken place, according to Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).</blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding the population of India, that is still a lot of transactions.</p>

        <p><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-feed-uae-india-plans-special-farms-infrastructure-for-export/articleshow/57484504.cms" target="_blank">Indrani Bagchil, reporting for Times of India</a>:</p>
<blockquote>As a first step, India is working on what is called a “farm-to-port” project, said Amar Sinha, secretary in ministry of external affairs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This would be something similar to a special economic zone but in the style of a corporatised farm, where crops would be grown keeping a specific UAE market in mind, with dedicated logistics infrastructure all the way to the port.</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. The UAE relies heavily on import to cater to its foodstuff needs, and is also a logistics hub in the region. This would mean a ‘dedicated’ farming grounds for the UAE population — an area they are limited in due to soil conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>India and the Gulf nations, Sinha said, are coordinating their websites and databases to protect expat labour, so Indian workers travelling to the GCC countries don’t get duped by exploitative agents or employers, as has been the case in several countries, notably Saudi Arabia.</blockquote>
<p>This would probably go down as a substantive reform for Indian labour in the years to come.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/03/02/it-wasnt-just.html">‘It wasn’t just DeMo’</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="https://swarajyamag.com/economy/it-wasnt-demo-indias-growth-blues-are-due-to-larger-disruptions-than-just-notebandi" target="_blank">R Jagannathan, writing for Swarajya</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Well, my advice to both sides is chill. There is no need to garland or shoot the CSO. The higher growth number does not necessarily validate DeMo. At best, we can say that DeMo was a minor disruption compared to the bigger disruptions happening around the world. As for detractors, they will get ample opportunities to pin the slowdown blame on DeMo, since 2016–17 has anyway seen a slowdown in growth relative to the year before.</blockquote>
<p>Ah, but we don’t know how to chill these days, do we? Or wait until we have enough quantifiable data to comment on something as large as demonetization, instead basing it on one statistic, either way, without establishing context.</p>
<blockquote>In other words, the deceleration due to DeMo itself may be marginal, but the broader slowdown relative to the last financial year is sharper.</blockquote>
<p>Another case where <a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/while-digitalisation-has-proceeded-cash-has-not-become-unimportant-44345fc93586" target="_blank">macro-context is important when judging what economic statistics reveal</a>. Growth was not at the same levels this year compared to last year in any event, and even without demonetization, an expectation of downturn in overall growth was to be expected. The point is, can we attribute the <em>entire</em> 0.4% drop from the previous quarter to demonetization? Jagannathan postulates, and I agree, that’s a no.</p>
<blockquote>The reality is that in a world of multiple disruptions there can be no normal level of growth for anybody.</blockquote>
<p>In Macroeconomics 101, right up in Chapter 1, one of the earliest lessons was that concurrency of two events does not imply causality. Economics is a complex ‘sport’, convoluted enough to stump even seasoned professionals.</p>
<hr />

<blockquote>The above data averages show that the basic trajectory of India’s growth was probably in the 5–6 per cent range for a very long time, both pre- and post-reform. The UPA period was an aberration, and high growth was driven by extremely favourable global conditions and by harvesting the fruits of reform sown during the Atal Behari Vajpayee period.</blockquote>
<p>This is good analysis, and telling when viewed through a larger spectrum (going back all the way to 1985). Our growth pattern has roughly stayed within the same bounds.</p>
<blockquote>Regardless of whether you measure GDP the old way or the new, we are still to recover fully from the self-inflicted wounds of the UPA era.</blockquote>
<p>Hurts.</p>
<hr />

<blockquote>The lessons for the Modi government are this:</blockquote>
<blockquote>One, keep plugging away at ease of doing business and reforming economic administration. Don’t obsess about the GDP growth rate, or celebrate some good numbers too soon.</blockquote>
<p>Agree. Think a good GDP outcome highlights the resilience of the Indian economy — against both global headwinds and internal disruptions, including demonetization. There are positive signals, such as <a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/explaining-q3-high-private-consumption-growth-3178908d49a6?source=collection_home---5------4----------" target="_blank">higher private consumption growth</a>, or the auto industry — widely believed to be a large struggler post November — <a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/auto-manufacturers-see-rise-in-february-sales-9f858244d92a?source=collection_home---5------7----------" target="_blank">reporting higher domestic sales</a>, and know Government collections are expected to go up via collections from both a wider tax base and the final payment of the Income Declaration Scheme 2016 come September 2017. But global conditions, and internal factors such as job slowdowns will need to be navigated.</p>
<blockquote>Two, big bang and incremental growth are not opposites. When the condition is ripe, go for big bang (GST is one example); when they are not, keep pushing small doses of reform where you can.</blockquote>
<p>No comment on the advice here, except that I think the Government has done this one thing absolutely right since coming to power. There is scope for deeper analysis on whether every reform was successful or not, but the fact that incremental and big bang reforms have been pursued hand in hand since May 2014 will be hard to argue against.</p>
<blockquote>Three, get states into the act. The centre cannot be the driving force of the economy. Reforms must touch states, and they hold the key to faster growth.</blockquote>
<p>Again, some positive moves have already happened, along with the change of revenue sharing, where they’re <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Politics/30dUP67qdzMMYV83n1WLkK/Finance-Commission-suggests-raising-share-of-states-in-centr.html" target="_blank">steadily increasing revenue sharing with states</a>. Obviously, just the funds aren’t enough, and State initiatives that extend Central initiatives where concurrent control exists have to be strengthened and audited.</p>
<blockquote>And four, forget about what is our potential rate of growth. We can only discover that by hindsight. In an unstable world, no growth outcome is likely to mirror our expectations. Economic forecasting is no better than astrology. We must negotiate growth in the fog generated by disruptive forces. This is why we got our DeMo forecasts wrong, for global disruptions are DeMo raised to the power of 10.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But if you still want a number, I would say India’s growth average will be in the 6–7 per cent range in the coming decade.</blockquote>
<p>I agree with just about everything in this post, except for the prediction numbers. My range would be 7–8 per cent, starting FY2019–20; we can expect the trend to be clear by the end of FY2018–19.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/arvindvirmani2/posts/736804226486834" target="_blank">Arvind Virmani, former CEA (2007–09) writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>(1) Sales which had happened during April-October but had not been declared, brought on the books.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(2) Artificial Sales receipts created to show accumulated cash as earned income to be able to safely deposit in bank.</blockquote>
<p>Evidence of (2) in entirely anecdotal at this point, so there is little to estimate really what/how much of this contributes to the growth bump. However, whether successful or not in ‘bypassing’ an Income Tax notice, the revenue is on the books and part of the formal economy now.</p>
<blockquote>(3) Temporary shift of consumer demand from unorganized to organized (taxed) sector so as to able to use cheque she or digital payments based on bank saving , as unavailable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(4) Temporary shift in production from cash strapped unorganized sector to organized/tax paying sector operating on cheque &amp; formal credit</blockquote>
<p>As Virmani himself mentions, both these factors repeating themselves will depend on how much of this shifts back to the ‘unorganized’ sector again as cash returns to the economy. While examples of this is still anecdotal as well, I expect a large number within the unorganized sector will choose to move into the organized framework, so the overall trend line will stay steady.</p>
<p>Additionally, the gains of demonetization starting to prop up growth via expanding the formal accounted economy is starting to show its weight in numbers.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-gdp-idINKBN16836O" target="_blank">Rajesh Kumar Singh, reporting for Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the October-December period came in at 7.0 percent, a tad slower than 7.4 percent in the previous quarter but much faster than the 6.4 percent expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.</blockquote>
<p>Yet another ‘economist-puzzling’ number as the Reuters’ headline reads. However, economists should notice that this is in-line with others such as <a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/nielsen-survey-consumer-confidence-hits-10-year-high-c539d1b03063?source=---------1" target="_blank">consumer confidence at a 10-year high</a>, or <a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/retail-inflation-lowest-in-5-years-ac3969b0178a?source=---------4" target="_blank">retail inflation hitting 5-year lows</a>. For context, this is the first GDP number available since demonetization, and also covers the core ‘trouble’ November-December phase.</p>
<p>It’s obviously normal to find economists of both sides of any argument, so there is little doubt that predictions range sizably in a situation where an economic exercise of these proportions has never been carried out before (anywhere). That numerous economists don’t seem to want to acknowledge the actual numbers, or analyze the undercurrent that is behind these numbers, is on them.</p>

<blockquote>“India today joined the distinguished club of countries that have malware-cleaning systems for the use of its citizens. As of now, we have 13 banks and internet service providers using this facility. With the expanding digital footprint in the country, I see a surge in start-ups in the area of cyber security by the end of the year,” said Union IT and Electronics Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at the event here.</blockquote>
<p>Another good element is the launch of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT-In) in the States, rather than just at the Centre.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/02/19/while-digitalisation-has.html">While digitalisation has proceeded, cash has not become unimportant</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://www.orfonline.org/expert-speaks/india-digital-payments-cash-here-to-stay/" target="_blank">Rupa Subramanya, writing for the Observer Research Foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Using data on the value of Point of Sale, Debit and Credit Card (PoS) transactions going back to April 2011, the earliest for which data is readily available, and the value of Immediate Payment Systems (IMPS) from September 2012, again the earliest for which data is available, I trace the dynamics of these two important components of digital payments.</blockquote>
<p>As always, Rupa brings in elaborate research and looks at longer-term trends.</p>
<p>On digitalization of the economy:</p>
<blockquote>It’s a no brainer that digitalisation of the economy has been underway well before demonetisation and is sure to continue post-demonetisation.</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/retail-inflation-lowest-in-5-years-ac3969b0178a#.4lb1u9dek" target="_blank">I raised a similar point about the drop in inflation</a>. Analyses that only look at trends post-demonetization fail in many ways, particularly in understanding how demonetization was an impetus, not a sudden strategic change in the larger picture. To this point:</p>
<blockquote>The crux is that those who claim that digitalisation fell in January by looking at only two or three data points completely miss the fact that this is still more than we would have had if demonetisation hadn’t occurred! The narrative of a sharp rise and then drop in digitalisation is simply misleading and based on poor data analysis. Even a cursory analysis of long term trends shows we’re still above trend, due to demonetisation.</blockquote>
<p>On cash in the economy:</p>
<blockquote>…while digitalisation has proceeded, cash has not become unimportant. It’s necessary to stress that this trend for cash incorporates a couple of months of data following demonetisation. If demonetisation indeed leads to less cash in the economy, we should see this elasticity fall over time.</blockquote>
<p>India has been a predominantly cash economy, and that’s not just a colloquial statement. After all, 1000 and 500 Rupee notes comprised 86% of the denomination in circulation. Even the Government has been focused on the narrative of a ‘less-cash’ economy. While numbers haven’t been revealed yet by the RBI, it does seem that the final cash in circulation number will be far short of the Rs. 15.44 lakh crore that was in circulation on Nov 8.</p>
<p>Rupa also correctly concludes that the foot cannot be lifted off the peddle now, not for quite a while. Read on for a detailed analysis, salivating stuff for the data nerds out there.</p>

        <p><a href="http://in.mobile.reuters.com/article/idINKBN15S1BB" target="_blank">Shailesh Andrade, reporting for Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Consumer prices rose by an annual 3.17 percent last month — their slowest pace since January 2012, when the government launched the current index series.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 3.22 percent from a year earlier, compared with December’s 3.41 percent increase.</blockquote>
<p>The article attributes the higher than expected drop to demonetization. The data, though, seems to indicate that while demonetization may have supplemented the decline, it is not the root cause — there has been a near consistent decrease in inflation since 2014, and would imply other economic and governance reasons are also playing a part. The trendline therefore makes for positive reading.</p>
<p>Since July 2016, which is the peak 6% seen last calendar year and 3 months pre-demonetization, it has dropped consistently month-to-month to end at 3.17% in January.</p>

<p>Those are good numbers that will boost India’s now active ‘Act East’ mantra. That said, shouldn’t we be trying to at least go 3G with new lines? Considering the target completion date, North East citizens will <em>finally</em> get just 2G connectivity in 2019?</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2017-18/bs/bs.docx" target="_blank">From Arun Jaitley’s budget speech</a>:</p>
<blockquote>142. During the period 8 November to 30 December 2016, deposits between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs 5.03 lakh.</blockquote>
<p>This amounts to INR5.48 lakh crores. On average though, what percentage of people who have INR 5 lakhs+ in cash have it for say a wedding or house purchase due to the requirement of cash/black money? Also, this is based on deposits made, so perhaps more than one deposit could have been made by the same person in different accounts, which will be tallied down the road.</p>
<p>This would imply that a decent volume of this cash could be both probed, and result in further tax collections.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<blockquote>Deposits of more than Rs 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs 3.31 crores.</blockquote>
<p>That’s another INR 4.89 lakh crore, and again, questions would be raised about availability of cash per person in excess of 3 crores.</p>
<p>This would imply that a good percentage of about INR 10 lakh crores of deposits (out of a total INR 15.44 lakh crores estimated to be in circulation) will result in tax collections.</p>
<p>So far, about <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/18-lakh-taxpayers-to-get-it-notices-to-explain-large-deposits-4500918/" target="_blank">18 lakh notices have already been sent out</a> in cases where deposits do not seem to be inline with income tax returns.</p>
