        <h2><a href="/2016/11/16/postdemonetization.html">Post-demonetization</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I’m not an economist, or any kind of finance wizard. That said, here are the various angles I see from a more macro-economic point of view. There were two main areas in my opinion that were the target of this currency demonetization.</p>
<ol>
<li>Corruption: India largely thrives on a what is terms as a parallel economy; double account bookkeeping is one of those unwritten ways of managing things. Take the example of real estate, the way to sell or buy property is by division between check payment (i.e., accounted money) and cash (unaccounted and therefore, not taxed). To facilitate this transaction, prices stay inflated. Another example would be wholesale traders who buy (and account for) stock partly officially, partly unofficially. When stock is sold though, traders would want to cover all costs though, so the price will always stay up (cost + tax + profit + cost of unaccounted stock). Sometimes this stock even gets hoarded, causing artificial scarcities which further drives prices up. It is also hard to track this stock since this is kept off book. Tax not paid on these parallel transactions is just one of the problems. What the demonetization has done is invalidate the ‘cash’ aspect of these transactions. Cash collected thus far unaccounted is negated, with further transactions nearly impossible. It also strikes a fear at the heart of these transactions, with murmurs that businessmen and traders are figuring out how to keep their transactions entirely white here on. Even if 20% traders decide this out of those that don’t transact in white, that’s quite a shift.</li>
<li>Terrorism. India suffers tremendously through cross-border terrorism, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/UnSubtleDesi/status/783631629826691072" target="_blank">a total of 6,255 jawans have lost their lives</a> (that’s not counting general public). Terrorism is funded primarily through two means — black, unaccounted money or fake currency (termed the Fake Indian currency network, or FICN). By devaluing the currency, a lot of this cash in hand is now useless. By the time the entire outfit resets itself to use the new currency — whether printing, or just getting ahold of cash outside the system — gives India the driving seat, by months at least. Already a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3939368/Maoists-RED-Modi-s-currency-crunch-cripples-Naxal-guerrilla-activities-Rs-7-500-crore-buried-underground-worthless.html" target="_blank">near-term impact can be seen</a>, schools reopened in Kashmir a couple of days ago, and a 94%+ attendance in exams after unrest that has lasted a quarter. Additional, news has been coming in on a joint India-China task force to crackdown on fake currency.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a secondary string of ‘benefits’ due to demonetization.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bank liquidity: With the requirement to deposit cash back into bank accounts and the limits in place, there is a massive boost to bank liquidity in the past week. In the first two days alone, approximately INR 53,000 crore was deposited, against INR 700 crore withdrawn. Cash consistently outside the banking system — and I mean accounted/white and black — isn’t great for liquidity, and this turns into a tremendous boost to banks.</li>
<li>RBI: In hand with (3), there is also a wiping of debt from India’s central bank. An estimated 14 lac crore rupees was out as cash in 500s and 1000s pre-8 Nov. A conservative estimate says 20% of this cash may not return, and since RBI will print new currency against what is accounted, this would mean a reduction in total actual cash that is printed. Using the same estimate, that’s about 2.8 lac crore (in black money) that is wiped out of the economy, and the RBI would only have outstanding currency printed as 11.2 lac crore instead of 14. Again not being an economist I may not be able to fully elucidate every benefit of this but this is definitely a positive. Considering money is being thrown away, and burnt in the aftermath, I do believe this estimate is fairly realistic.</li>
<li>Prices: prices will come down. Already reports are coming out that wholesalers are dumping stock to compensate losses and fear of transaction issues. A large percentage of real estate transactions will stop seeing the black side of the transactions altogether; resulting in first a slump in prices as the market grapples with the aftermath, followed by a proper correction in prices to more realistic numbers that I believe will still be lower than pre-8Nov values.</li>
<li>Government dues collections: There is a massive rise in Government dues collections since 8 Nov. Since Govts are allowed to collect payments — taxes, fines and electricity — until Nov 24, a lot of people are attempting to clear out their payments and dues using old currency. This has resulting in an instant rise in Government collections. For example, Maharashtra State Governement and local bodies saw a <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-local-bodies-mop-up-rs400-crore-bmc-nets-rs49-45-crore-in-3-days/story-oecCIRmVEMXk0MvM4mMdjP.html" target="_blank">collection of INR 400 crore in outstanding dues within 3 days</a>. That’s a start. Railways and Air travel, which is also accepted old notes, have already said <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2016/nov/10/no-cash-refunds-for-cancelled-tickets-above-rs-10000-1537114.html" target="_blank">no cash refunds will be provided</a> for large transactions to prevent this being used as a currency switcher.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Move to cashless economy</h4>
<p>I want to address this aspect since it is being brought up a lot. It does seem, if you analyze the Government’s moves since 2014, that there is in fact a gradually increasing nudge towards a more cashless economy (not entirely, but significantly higher than it currently is). Between pushing the poor to open <a href="http://www.pmjdy.gov.in" target="_blank">zero-balance zero-fee accounts</a>, the RBI building a <a href="http://www.npci.org.in/home.aspx" target="_blank">Unified Payments Interface (UPI)</a> for peer-to-peer fund transfers between institutions and finally demonetization requiring money to be deposited back into banks, various areas are already seeing a rise in cashless transactions (cards, check, etc). That said, I do not believe demonetization single handedly solves this; India is still largely a cashless economy. Once lies reduce, cash starts to find its way bank in the hands of the people, cash transactions will resume, especially since various places do not yet have the ability to accept electronic currency and cash is convenient. There will still be a shift, a percentage of people starting to use more plastic and bank transfers to manage in the interim will continue down this path, and the younger generation is more savvy and open to this as well. Gateway providers like PayTM and others will also look to cash in on the demonetization, so that will nudge the economy further.</p>
<h4>What happens next</h4>
<p>There’s a lot of talk around ‘this is not enough’, ‘this does not really stop black money’ and ‘how will introducing a higher (2000) denomination solve the problem caused by a lower (1000) denomination’. I think it’s important to remember what this was set out to do: in my opinion, this was to kill black, unaccounted cash out in the economy (and therefore directly attacking existing corruption and terrorism that is elevated by this cash). More has to happen to control further generation, naturally. Remember that simultaneous raids were carried out at 100s of jewelers, various industries around Nov 10 to clarify transfer of cash into these industries in the hope of emptying thus far stashed currency. Other moves such as requiring PAN cards for jewelry transactions above certain amounts are further aimed at limiting new generation. I do believe the real estate sector will be hit next if not already. A crackdown has already been announced against those who have bank deposits not matching their tax returns. These actions will push more and more people to be careful about whether they wish to indulge this route further, and the small percentage that will continue — as they do in every economy — will be far, far smaller than what they were pre-8Nov. The advent of GST expected in FY 2017 will further add to their pain.</p>
<p>Regarding the currency, it was natural that 14 lac crore in currency would not be circulated entirely in 500s. Someone has highlighted how a different higher denomination also curbs a deposit switcharoo, which has some merit, but is not easy to do. That said, there are two places where the new 2000 denomination really helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>By keeping a larger difference between 500 and the next denomination means the general perception will be to use (and therefore stock on) 500s over 2000s. This means that lesser 2000s will be printed in general (this has been stated anyway), and the difference in wipe out of existing currency in circulation will come out of the 2000 account. This would make it harder to stash the same volumes of currency entirely in black; and the next available denomination is straight down to 500, significantly multiplying the amount of currency required.</li>
<li>Also remember that getting hold of a 2000 requires some level of routing through the banking system. While an exchange option is available, a citizen is allowed to exchange a maximum of INR4,500 one-time (through filling out a declaration form). Any further 2000s will enter the system through accounted money, via bank withdrawals. This does mean it will be harder to then dispose this currency into the ‘black’ economy, not impossible, but significantly harder. If the tax authorities do their jobs right, unexplained disappearance/inconsistent expenses of currency will be curbed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I know and fully understand the micro-economic inconvenience being caused while banks come to terms with handling the onslaught of citizens wanted to exchange, switch and withdraw currency to manage their day-to-day. This post in no way minimizes that burden, and a shoutout must go to bank staff who are working double, triple shifts to help people. Various citizens are also visiting banks to distribute water, tea and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/TajinderBagga/status/797704324407099393" target="_blank">even help people fill out forms</a> as they stand in line, while switching to majority cashless transactions so they don’t add to lines. It is a testament to the resolve of the country that this is happening across the nation today.</p>
<p>Onward and upward.</p>

<p>News of an announcement flickered in around 7.50 p.m. IST, an address to the nation was on the cards. What followed is fairly accurately described as India’s biggest take on black (think money acquired through non-documented means) money. Some quick facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The existing (as of Nov 8, 2016) INR500 and 1000 notes will no longer be legal tender. Essentially you cannot use that to make purchases anymore*. Lower denominations continue as is.</li>
<li>* Various establishments including Petrol pumps, government hospitals will continue to accept these notes until midnight on Nov 11.</li>
<li>Banks will be closed during the day Nov 9, 2016, as will ATMs. Various ATMs will stay closed on Nov 10, 2016.</li>
<li>As a citizen, what you can do: starting Nov 10, you can deposit existing 500/1000 rupee notes into banks, post offices via accounts and you will be credited, until Dec 30, 2016.</li>
<li>After Dec 30, special RBI centers will continue to accept these denominations for deposit into accounts until end of the fiscal year, March 31, 2017.</li>
<li>New notes of INR500 and INR2000 will trickle into the banks over the next few days and weeks.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rs-500-and-rs-1000-notes-banned-your-questions-answered-by-the-rbi/articleshow/55320904.cmshttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rs-500-and-rs-1000-notes-banned-your-questions-answered-by-the-rbi/articleshow/55320904.cms" target="_blank">A full RBI FAQ is available</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at how this has come full circle since 2014, when the new Govt. took over, you can almost see the plan coming together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion via Jan Dhan Yojna (accounts for every citizen). Bringing the average Indian into mainstream banking, where India lacked severely.</li>
<li>Income declaration scheme (IDS) in 2016. The Indian Government gave an opportunity to every citizen to declare black money until Sept 30, 2016 with penalties (45% of declared amounts), but without prosecution. Various notices of large transactions were sent to business owners before the window closed to serve as a warning.</li>
<li>GST beginning next Fiscal year, with centralized tax accountability.</li>
<li>Finally, the demonetization of the notes. By conservative estimates, even if 20% of the money is a no-show, approximately 3 lac crore of unaccounted money will be wiped clean from the system. Additionally, GST gets a near-clean accounting slate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there will be an inconvenience around getting all the existing notes into banks; and while businesses and shopkeepers refuse to accept the old notes. If people however give i<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/HerrBains/status/796019043375251456" target="_blank">t a chance, and look beyond the ne</a>xt few weeks, a massive move towards accounted, and cashless economy is in the offing. But stories are already coming out of shopkeepers who are offering items on credit until the new notes trickle out.</p>
<p>Spare a thought for those who hoarded black money over years and years, stored in the highest denominations, in cash, that just became food wrappers. Being unable to deposit this money in banks today, unable to exchange it for gold or other goods stifles them in ways that are unexpected. Add to that the announcement being made post 8 p.m., barely 4 hours before closing and post close of markets. It is being said that <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rs-500-and-rs-1000-notes-banned-how-modi-kept-his-black-money-masterstroke-a-secret-for-6-months/articleshow/55327863.cms" target="_blank">it was a closely guarded announcement between the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and RBI Governor</a>. I wouldn’t be surprised if most/all in the Cabinet were unaware <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PIB_India/status/795991686069428224" target="_blank">until their meeting the hour before the announcement</a>, as evidenced by the lack of understanding within the media what the announcement was for, until it was actually made.</p>
<p>This was indeed a colossal move. Watch it unfold.</p>
<p>Update, 10 Nov:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unexpectedly, people are <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANINewsUP/status/796562774600073216" target="_blank">queuing up</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796572422128410625" target="_blank">outside banks</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796569839427063808" target="_blank">all morning</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796577178460753924" target="_blank">in panic</a>.</li>
<li>Announcements filtered in late evening that unaccounted deposits, as compared to the declared income of the previous FY would be <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796380846747885568" target="_blank">subject to a 200% penalty</a>. In essence, one would pay 30% tax + 200% penalty, essentially 90% of the cash deposited.</li>
<li>Entirely expectedly, people are <a href="http://bit.ly/2fEaVPX" target="_blank">leaving cash on the streets</a>, or <a href="http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/sacks-burnt-rs-500-rs-1000-notes-found-uttar-pradesh-52674" target="_blank">burning it</a>.</li>
<li>Banks will operate normal working hours Sat, Nov 12 and Sun, Nov 13 to ease the transition.</li>
<li>CEA Arvind Subramanian is right is calling it a ‘<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796590914315685888" target="_blank">transfer of unaccounted wealth</a>’. In other words, this is the first time in a long time where honest tax-paying citizens will finally be glad to have been that way.</li>
<li>I expect real estate markets nationwide to crash for a while. As the industry with a large amount of unaccounted money paid, a massive inflation remained in property value which would be wiped clean due to this move. That said, in a few months, expect a gradual correction would bring prices to a more realistic value.</li>

        <h2><a href="/2016/06/27/a-warby-parker.html">A Warby Parker experience</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I discovered <a href="http://www.warbyparker.com/" target="_blank">Warby Parker</a> thanks to Gruber’s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/" target="_blank">The Talk Show</a>, where there were a sponsor. Their message was interesting: custom made frames, good quality glasses, reasonable pricing <em>and </em>for every pair you purchase, they donate one to someone in need.</p>
<p>WP is an entirely online service (although they do have stores in New York) so the trick would be determining whether the glasses actually work for you. Two items help here. First, WP offers a free home-try on — select 5 frames, and they ship it to you to try on. I was visiting the US earlier this year, so I was able to give this option a go.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">5 frames to try on at home</figcaption></figure>
<p>Second, one rarely pays attention to the measurement indicators available on each pair of glasses when you visit an option (well, at least I’ve never looked). Based on my current pair, I was able to select frames that were close enough (slightly better, slightly smaller, and similarly sized) to help me decide.</p>
<p>WP is reasonable with their costs as well: $95 gets you the frames with polycarbonate anti-reflective &amp; UV-protective single-vision glasses, and a one year guarantee for scratches. 1 Warby Parker will ship you just the frames too if you prefer to purchase them without prescription glasses.</p>
<p>The order process is straightforward. Pick your glasses (and color where applicable), upload a copy of your prescription, and you’re on your way. WP asks that you upload a prescription either with an expiration date, or with a test date taken within the last 2 years. They’re prompt with answers, confirmed they were happy with my prescription scan and the wait began.</p>
<p>My glasses were delivered within the expected 10 days, although it did take me another week to receive it in this part of the world. I want to add here that the packaging is great too.</p>
<figure>

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/9b3bb-1wp9zpf7yu0-hrwczi03oog.jpeg" />
</figure>
<p>Will have to wait and see how durable the frames are, but so far I’m extremely happy with the purchase. The net cost is reasonable for the quality of Glasses currently sitting on my nose though.</p>
<p>Ya know, I’d love to know more about their donations, while there is some text on their site about the subject, it would add to their feel-good appeal if they shared more pictures of this too.</p>
<p>For those living outside the US, this option can be a bit tricky, so I’d recommend figuring out a way to try them out first. I’m very likely to go back next time though since I’m confident about the frame sizes and expectations now.</p>

<strong>Wokyo Noodle Bar</strong><br />Cuisine: Asian<br />Rating: <strong>3.7</strong>/5</blockquote>
<p>It would seem unfair to call Wokyo Noodle Bar the Subway of noodle houses but that’s the first parallel that comes to mind. Wokyo is a simple but effective noodle house, you pick out your ingredients and they ‘wok’ it up in front of you, fresh as ever.</p>
<p><span>W</span>okyo attempts to keep things fairly authentic on their menu — it’s not a complex menu at that, the main course being noodles or rice, cooked in the sauce you select and the protein of choice. They do carry other appetizers and a couple of salads as well so this is handy if you’re in a larger group. However, their noodle servings are quite satisfactory per person.</p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sauces on trial.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In total, Wokyo boasts 8 different sauces — from the Bangkok Coconut Curry to the Tokyo Miso &amp; Sesame. Their ambience feels pretty fresh and mostly friendly. The only caveat in our experience was when I asked the server repeatedly to explain what the sauce ingredients were so I wouldn’t have to look them up off the menu (Seoul is Fiery Sriracha for example), he kept pointing out that the names were next to the sauces already, and I kept trying to explain that I wanted to know what Seoul contained. After a couple of tries, it was just easier to read them off the menu. Wokyo lets you try out the sauces upfront, which is neat.</p>
<p>In an attempt to cover as much of the menu possible, we chose different noodle types (and one steamed rice option) each with a different sauce. I do believe certain combinations would work better than others — the Buckwheat noodles for example may not work that well with something like the Peanut, but an exhaustive list of recommendations would take me too many tries to perfect. Sorry!</p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">In focus: Udon noodles in Bangkok Coconut Curry, with lotus root chips behind them.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We sampled the Fiery Sriracha, the Bangkok Coconut Curry, the Thai Peanut, the Tokyo Miso &amp; Sesame, the light soy. Of these, the one that didn’t work for me was the Thai Peanut — the end result was very dry and a bit tough to enjoy. My guests preferred the Tokyo Miso &amp; Sesame which was delicious, while my personal choice of light soy with buckwheat noodles was also really good. The noodles were all well cooked so we had no complaints there. I personally love buckwheat noodles, but for the traditional noodle eaters, Egg noodles and Udon are both available. One point, if you order the rice option, you would receive the proteins or veggies cooked in sauce, with rice steamed on the side, unlike the noodles which are mixed in.</p>
<p>In addition to a Lavazza coffee bar, Wokyo also has your more traditional Thai Iced Tea and Matcha tea options, hot and cold. I stuck with my tested Matcha Iced Tea latte (soy milk) and that worked well.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s an enjoyable experience, the interiors are fun, just a little quirky and they’ve given the outside area good lighting, which was very appreciated (and resulted in better than average pictures).</p>

<blockquote>Farzi Café, Dubai: <strong>3.4</strong> / 5</blockquote>
<p>It’s not often that a review makes you struggle with the outcome. <a href="http://www.farzicafe.com/farzi-cafe.php" target="_blank"><em>Farzi Café</em></a> made this review tough; primarily because it’s hard not to draw parallels to <a href="http://www.tresind.com/" target="_blank"><em>TresInd</em></a> — one of my favorite restaurants but I haven’t reviewed it yet (whops). Second, it didn’t help that <em>Farzi</em> has a few things really going for it and others that hold it back.</p>
<p>Let me table the suspense first up: the two restaurants don’t really fall in the same class, and you’d be disappointed if you, like me, compared your experiences. It also wouldn’t really be fair to <em>Farzi Café</em>, so we’ll endeavor to let it stand on its own.</p>
<p><span>F</span><em>arzi</em> truly represents Dubai’s unending obsession with the new &amp; different. ‘Reservations are completely full until Sunday,’ we were informed the first weekend. The earliest weekend booking I could make on a Tuesday was for Saturday, and they weren’t kidding. The scene was crowded when we arrived.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/63493-1_lx-s_fvbapdb1jcdjaala.jpeg" />

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Big menus, loads of white space and a little table.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Right away, we were introduce to Problem One: while their interiors are done up well, the tables are incredibly cramped. I believe our table would have served maybe three people at best (we were 5) and was incredibly narrow, making the person sitting along the edge (yours truly) struggling for space. Behind us were a family of 9; their table while longer was not any wider. We barely got over the grumbling when Problem Two was dumped on us: a humungous (in context of the table) menu.</p>
<p>Restaurants should really think this stuff through, and this turned out to be the most irritating thing about <em>Farzi</em>. Two people sitting across from each other couldn’t place their menu face down on the table without colliding, only made worse when you have 3 people sitting at one end. (Spoiler: we just shared our menus). This was made worse by the design of the menu itself; I have no problem with funky (there were cute quotes in each section too) but reading up dish names with four different font styles starts to get irritating while you elbow your dinner companions. All the while, I couldn’t help thinking that a smaller font would have lead to a smaller menu (most pages only had 4 items listed) and a significantly more comfortable reading experience. You essentially sit there hoping the food has some redeeming qualities.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/38fbf-1i7rxzbxqjvhjdagc11znvw.jpeg" />

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sorry, but that’s just irritating to read. I don’t mind funky, but pick one style at a time?</figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, there is hope. Their drinks menu — a welcome surprise of sanity-prevailing smaller fonts bound in a rather compact looking menu — is extensive, and concoctions likekadak chai soda and curry leaf mocktail turned out to be delicious even if a little too sweet. The waiter informed us the drinks were pre-made and there was no option to have a non-/less- sugar version. Tough.</p>
<p>The problem persisted with the Raj Kachori. While a delectable presentation with use of a chutney foam, spicy pumpkin mash on the inside and fried okra, the yogurt was far (far) too sweet for my taste buds, taking it almost into the dessert category. A little adjustment here would do wonders to the dish.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Raj Kachori: Stuffed with sweet yogurt and spicy mashed pumpkin, side of fried okra and covered in sweet chutney foam.</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Farzi</em> tries to be inventive with their food, which works in some cases, and isn’t a home run, but still good. The curry leaf mocktail was actually delicious, the okra-pumpkin touches in the Raj Kachori inspired, and the truffle sliders were heartwarming for a truffle/mushroom lover (and arrived in a US army truck of all things). There was also the aubergine steak (yes, aubergine), topped with babaganoush and a side of salan sauce, which was absolutely the highlight of the menu. The paneer tikka wasn’t the most inventive of dishes, but still cooked well although the presentation was a little messy.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The aubergine steak: Grilled eggplant stuffed with babaganoush, side of salan sauce and Ajwain naan. Perfect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I did however feel <em>Farzi</em>’s menu was also a tad limited. Not that they didn’t have enough options, but a case in point: the appetizers section had tandoori chili cheese kulchas, and also a paratha enchiladas. While technically different, it was two versions of the same thing. I trust they’ll expand as time goes on, but it took a bit of effort to try and find enough different styles or dishes to sample for a larger group.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sir, sliders reporting, sir! Truffle mushroom sliders in homemade buns</figcaption></figure>
<p>There was another dish that was served up in a red telephone booth, and the bill &amp; comment card arrived on a typewriter. It’s a cute idea no doubt, but again, perhaps a smaller typewriter that didn’t eat up most of the table would have been a cleaner touch.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Typewriter, with a side of your bill.</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Farzi</em>’s outside seating only caters dessert, and you have to be seated inside for their full menu. We didn’t land up trying dessert; I didn’t mind since I had been downing the two rather sweet drinks all through dinner. I almost sound like a broken record now, but each time a dish was served up, something had to be moved around or taken off the table. Rarely were two dishes served at once, so the eating experience is a bit disconnected.</p>
<p>Bottom line, I see why <em>Farzi Café</em> is the current hotspot in the city. Good flavors coupled with interesting presentation and the ‘ooh shiny’ new factor work in its favor. Is that enough to take away from the negatives? Somewhat. It will be interesting to see how Farzi continues to draw in the crowds, particularly with newer inventive dishes.</p>
<p>It’s good, but not great. I felt <em>Farzi</em> fell slightly short of the finish line; I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for larger groups looking to sample everything, but it’s worth trying as a new experience.</p>
<p>But I genuinely hope their management reviews the seating arrangement; this is undoubtedly their weakest link.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2016/03/22/day-in-day.html">Day in, day out with the iPad Pro</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>It’s been about 60 days since I’ve been using the iPad Pro as my primary computer, backed by my iPhone 6. Overall, this has been an incredibly smooth transition, and I find myself agreeing entirely with what other people are saying: iOS is seductive <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/01/ios/" target="_blank">enough to rope you in.</a></p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/2b68e-1l6ttkkzkgqqk6hmftny6ga.jpeg" />

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yes, this was typed entirely on the iPad Pro. Thanks <a href="https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6" target="_blank">Medium</a>!</figcaption></figure>
<hr />

<p>As such, I have already leaned on my iPhone for most day to day tasks — emails, task management, social media and even various corporate applications — all of which have been available for the iPad for some time now. In fact, I found the app experience typically beat the browser based one. In my case, I moved from a 5-year old MacBook Pro, as though someone had strapped a booster engine to my chair.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Ben Brooke says:<a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/01/ios/" target="_blank"></a></p>
<blockquote>On a Mac you have to decide if your window is going to be full screen or not. If it is full screen, is it full screen but split with another app, if so by how much? Or is it going to be a window on the desktop, if so where and how large? Repeat that for every app, and a lot of your day becomes just managing the size and location of your windows.</blockquote>
<p>You’d think this wouldn’t make a difference, but it does. I am still surprised sometimes how quickly I go from ‘sit down’ to ‘getting started’ compared to last year. Sure, there will always be the other side of the argument — people who believe you cannot be a power user without the ability to have full control of the desktop environment. For them, and others, the MacBooks and other laptops aren’t going away (yet). But for a lot of us, this ‘distraction free’ zone has massive appeal.</p>
<p>Nowadays I’m all about the ‘start up, and go’. Even when I do need another application, it’s look up and shoo out of the way. It is almost a change in mindset.</p>
<hr />

<p>You also start to get surprised by how many things become extraneous after a while. My iPhone and iPad just stay in sync, from Photos to files within Dropbox or iCloud. Sure, this can be done on a PC too, but you actually have to plan &amp; think about it plus there are some differences.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/38261-1kafs-a1v65k5jih1vtx2kw.jpeg" />

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">From storage to upload, without managing your own disks.</figcaption></figure>
<p>On a “traditional computer”, the price of control is the time and energy you spend over the file system. I refer to that in-between state, that ‘Downloads’ folder where you stash something before you get it to your place of use. The iPad forces me to act on a file immediately, go from email directly to Dropbox, for example; open file directly in Pages or Word without first stashing it somewhere within the file system and the occasional man-hunt.</p>
<p>Even my parents have forgotten what their file system used to be like (thank goodness). This was after tremendous opposition to removing their PC away from its permanent spot at the corner of our dining table; now they haven’t gone anywhere near it in the last year, and I’m merrier for the lack of support requests from them that ended in me formatting their hard drives in the middle of the night. Their computer needs are wholly met between their iPhones (75%), and the occasional iPad usage. My ratio may be further tilted towards the iPad but it’s still happily nestled inside iOS.</p>
<hr />

<p>On the entertainment front, with Netflix available worldwide and updated for the iPad Pro’s resolution, the iPad is pretty much a permanent fixture to my body at the moment.</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I expected to face decent challenges around the file system. As I’ve already mentioned, it turns out the iPad actually runs into this with an advantage. The other expected areas, intensive activities such as server lookups and code review were oddly enough easy as well.</p>
<p>Where I have faced actual challenges is sites that haven’t (or can’t) be used with a primarily non-mouse based input. There are two such cases I face currently and, while marginal, make for an undesirable scenario where I have to carry around my MacBook Pro <em>also. </em>That said, I expect either the vendors will add relevant support for the iPad, or people will eventually move to vendors who will.</p>
<p>In reality, the main (and maybe only) area requiring adjustment is breaking muscle memory to reach for a mouse or trackpad, and getting used to touching the screen when in pure typing mode. What helped my transition considerably is that I began using a regular iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard. This made the move from <em>keyboard+trackpad</em> to <em>keyboard+touch</em> smoother. Decades of ‘regular’ computer experience and muscle memory does take some snapping out of though. I can also neither confirm nor deny that I might now be infected with a condition where I randomly start touching my MacBook Pro screen from time to time.<em></em></p>
<hr />

<p>It was easy to see that the <a href="https://medium.com/@chiragnd/the-ipad-pro-and-who-s-it-for-e6e66ef6877f#.7wxxp4j6u" target="_blank">iPad Pro could take on the role of my primary computer</a>. Apple clearly thinks so too, having updated their <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/21Apple-Introduces-9-7-inch-iPad-Pro.html" target="_blank">9.7" iPad to be a part of the Pro family</a> this week.</p>
<p>The transition turned out to be smoother than I expected and while I haven’t reached the 100% PC free zone yet, 99% in 60 days is pretty darned good.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://india.gov.in/" target="_blank">Government of India (GoI)</a> is currently targeting to have an estimated remaining 18000 new villages electrified by 2019. What’s interesting, about this is that they have launched an app for the general public to track their progress:</p>
<p>[embed]<a href="https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal/status/666266468791812098">twitter.com/PiyushGoy…</a>[/embed]</p>
<p>Pretty cool indeed. As pointed out, iOS / Web users can track this <a href="http://kyrosoft.com/recpms/dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>. As any government should, MoS for Power, Coal, New &amp; Renewable energy Piyush Goyal is asking citizens to hold them accountable towards this promise, as we should. Considering additional statements made recently such as <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/i-have-given-states-an-offer-they-can-t-refuse-piyush-goyal-115111800047_1.html" target="_blank">UDAY discom debt scheme</a> and a projection of <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/india-wont-need-coal-imports-by-2017-piyush-goyal/articleshow/49801341.cms?utm_source=hootsuite" target="_blank">not importing thermal coal by 2017</a>, I think these are good signs for India in terms of power distribution. Watching closely.</p>

        <p>Brooke Crothers, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2015/11/15/ipad-pro-gripe-fest-vs-the-12-inch-retina-macbook/" target="_blank">writing for Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/11/12/ipad-pro-review-roundup-inching-closer-to-laptop-replacement.html" target="_blank">preponderance of the gripes in reviews</a> from most of the major tech sites is that it falls short as a laptop replacement. Here’s a quick solution (if you’re in the market for an iPad with a real keyboard): move a few feet (if you’re in the Apple Store) to the table with 12-inch Retina MacBook. The tablet-like 2-pound MacBook is about the same weight as the iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard (iPad Pro is about 1.6 pounds and the Smart Keyboard is about 0.5 pounds). And about the same price: $1,248 for the 128GB cellular iPad Pro and keyboard and $1,299 for the 256GB 12-inch MacBook.</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. I get that Apple is marketing this as a laptop replacement, but even Tim Cook says it’s really about <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11984806/Apples-Tim-Cook-declares-the-end-of-the-PC-and-hints-at-new-medical-product.html" target="_blank">a lot of people who will no longer buy laptops</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“I think if you’re looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one?”, asks Tim Cook</blockquote>
<blockquote>[…]</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones,” Cook argues…</blockquote>
<p>It’s not supposed to do things the way laptops do things — if that’s what you want, you get a laptop.</p>
<p>And don’t be shocked when iOS 10 brings in more support for a physical keyboard to navigate around the OS. But for heaven’s sake, <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/ipad-pro-review-initial/40395/" target="_blank">expecting</a> a pointer is just silly. If anything, Apple would consider something more along the lines of the TV interface trackpad, but I think even that is pushing it.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2015/11/08/some-thoughts-post.html">Some thoughts post the Bihar election results</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I’ll start with this, I’m a big fan of our PM Narendra Modi. I say this having tracked him lightly over the last (5) years, ie his Gujarat tenure, and more seriously over the last (2) years, leading to his ascendency to the PM’s chair last year to date.</p>
<p>Since then, lots of things have happened, some predictably so. Overall, the GoI has performed reasonably well. Sure, there are those who want the big bang reforms and headlines but many circles admit that there is a lot of cleanup that needs to be done on the ground. Slowly but surely, the economic indicators are moving in favor of India—<a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-ranks-130-in-ease-of-doing-business-report-jumps-12-spots-1237167" target="_blank">ease of business rankings</a>, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/12/03/india-ranked-less-corrupt-than-china-for-the-first-time-in-18-years/" target="_blank">improvements against corruption</a>, and maybe more generally, <a href="http://www.rediff.com/business/report/pix-special-most-valuable-nation-brands-india-ranks-at-7/20151012.htm" target="_blank">brand India</a>. Internally, schemes for the poor, <a href="http://www.pmjdy.gov.in/account-statistics-country.aspx" target="_blank">financial inclusion</a>, movements towards <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/why-uday-discom-restructuring-initiative-will-work-goyal_4015181.html" target="_blank">electrification of India</a>, and attempts towards <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/business/pm-modi-says-transforming-reform-is-a-marathon-not-a-sprint-wants-india-to-be-a-job-creator-2497506.html" target="_blank">developing the manpower of India as well</a>. Recently, even <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/once-a-month-pm-narendra-modi-steps-in-to-revive-stalled-projects-1238011" target="_blank">reports of Mr. Modi’s project management</a> — things I’ve heard many times in Gujarat—have been shared. This is how he works, and Mr. Modi will always be the man for long term implementation vision &amp; capabilities — something I have seen myself over the last 10 years in Gujarat.</p>
<p>But things are more center stage now for him. And a strong counter narrative to his efforts has been in the making since May last year. But let’s be honest, the <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/hook-line-and-sinker-modis-media-baiters-laid-a-trap-for-him-and-he-walked-into-it-2482626.html" target="_blank">GoI hasn’t entirely helped</a>, and a lot of the narrative problems are internal to the BJP (which sadly affects the GoI directly). Leaders like Shatrugan Sinha who <a href="https://twitter.com/ShatruganSinha/status/655612079840235521" target="_blank">openly give importance to comments</a> against the party, and <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjps-kailash-vijayvargiya-makes-friends-and-controversies-easily-1240154" target="_blank">various other sideliners</a> who loudmouth (and sometimes get sucked into) ridiculous comments clearly does not go down well in the electorate. It is unfortunate that every single BJP comment is highlighted to the skies, while ridiculous comments made otherwise are sidelined quickly. Let’s not even get into the <a href="http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-is-the-supreme-court-angry-with-sanjiv-bhatt/" target="_blank">Sanjive Bhatt episode</a> that barely saw the light of day, and was mostly kept to online versions.</p>
<p>The counter-Modi narrative worked in Delhi, and we now know it has worked in Bihar. Everything from AwardWapsi, Dadri and Kalburgi has stuck. The technicality clearly doesn’t matter; whether the GoI is directly responsible or not can be argued till the sun goes down but it doesn’t matter. The perception is clearly sticking and working against the narrative Mr. Modi (and the BJP) has painstakingly built leading to May 2014. The Congress in particular has been smart, and have carefully used non-Congress voices knowing that the electorate was less likely to hear them out based on their voting history as well.</p>
<p>There is also growing resentment around the fact that the justice timeframe in India is far too slow. No doubt, the GoI continues to take steps to solve that problem, but the fact that numerous accused are roaming free—take the case of Lalu Yadav who has won the election in Bihar while out on bail, and he’s convicted—reflects badly on the GoI and for the future of India as a whole. <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bikaner-land-grab-case-enforcement-directorate-searches-premises-of-delhi-firm-1239415" target="_blank">Even when some effort is being made</a>, it is largely swept under the carpet.</p>
<p>I can’t say that I know Mr. Modi well; I actually don’t at all. But I can somewhat say that I know his ability to work and succeed beyond what the rhetoric may say about him. This defeat too shall pass. The opposition will do better than to underestimate him as a person, and his political will. He will continue to have my support &amp; <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/09/17/1-the-modi-phenomenon/" target="_blank">the support of the country</a>. But it is now time to evaluate some of the strategy, the media, the loudmouths and forces that hamper the future of our country, and his own office. And the message has to be equally cumulative.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2015/09/30/the-ipad-pro.html">The iPad Pro and why it’s for me</a></h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There seem to be two central questions around the recently announced (but long rumored) <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a>: Why, and who is it for?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ipad/ipad-pro-review-3580947/" target="_blank">Macworld UK</a>’s review mentioned even the name seemed off; I think however resemblance to other tablets is more coincidental. Apple is bringing consistency in its PC and tablet line-up: the Airs for regular users, the Pros for the ones that need more computing power.</p>
<p>But this parallel goes much beyond the name. We are at a post of close convergence between Apple’s laptop and tablet lineup.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>The new iPhone 6S beats the new MacBook in single-core performance on Geekbench</em>, and is within spitting distance in multi-core. That’s astounding. I can’t wait to see the scores for the iPad Pro later this year. — John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/09/the_iphones_6s" target="_blank">the iPhones 6s</a>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the right question in deciding whether you prefer the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" target="_blank">Macbook</a> or the iPad therefore, is the one posted a few days ago (really sorry I seem to have lost the link): Do you want to touch your screen or not?</p>
<p>I believe there are <a href="https://500ish.com/crossing-the-ipad-rubicon-51bbdb52bf48" target="_blank">enough people like me</a> who would love to give up their laptops for the ‘freedom’ of the iPad, not that interested in keeping two major devices in our lives in addition to the iPhone. What I’ve realized though is that since getting the iPhone 6 last year, I find I have transferred a lot of processing to it already — primarily when I’m working through my inbox — without the hassle of pulling out my Macbook each time. I found this particularly true when I traveled.</p>
<p>Rewind about 8 months ago, and I tried using an iPad as my primary device to see if it really did fit into my life. I ran into two major problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The screen wasn’t large enough to use without an external monitor (for work). It may be a non-retina Macbook, the 13" works really well.</li>
<li>Working through email while browsing for some information, reviewing code while testing — these were doable, but tedious. Double tap, click app, double tap, you get the drift. More so when you didn’t hit the gesture right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of my primary issues are seemingly addressed by the iPad Pro, with the 12.9" screen that’s twice the resolution I use today and side-by-side views in iOS 9. But there’s more. 95% of my life is within the browser — social life, work web applications and other time beyond just browsing. The same are apps on my iPhone and quite a few of them — Twitter, Facebook, accounting apps — offer a better experience compared to the browser, and the iPad Pro stands to gain again due to its screen size.</p>
<p>I have been considering (and re-considering) upgrading to the new Macbook towards the end of the year. The iPad Pro announcement has made me compare them. They’re both approximately the same screen size (12.9" vs the 12") and weight so it becomes a question of whether I want OS X or iOS to be my primary operating system.</p>

<p>I think the iPad can suffice as the primary device and this has been the case since perhaps the iPad 4 or the iPad Air where browsing, email and social media were the primary tasks, such as been the case for my parents, who ditched their PC two years ago. I think with the iPad Pro, we will see the next exodus from the laptop era, with the device definitely targeting a niche — computing power with the freedom of iOS.</p>
<p>Developers will no doubt start to review their apps, and build new ones to further move traditional PC-only tasks to apps, similar to the AutoCAD 360 example. Apple is betting on that.</p>
<p>And I want in.</p>

        <p>Life is no longer just a yes or a no. Almost always, the answer is ‘it depends.’</p>
<p>What I do for a living involves technological babble, nerd speak. But it still doesn’t mean I know everything about your situation to provide you a consult. That’s why more often that not it’s ‘it depends’. This is the right approach for your IT environment provided a, b &amp; c. Based on x, y &amp; z, you should do this. It depends.</p>
<p>The same happens with food. Two different people asking me for a recommendation for a place to eat out will be often given two different responses, even if the cuisine is the same. Some people relate to my experience better; others prefer things that are different from me. Again, it depends.</p>
<p>We live in a world of many, many choices. Technology, politics, food, life.</p>
<p>To the world at large: stop expecting finite answers, and stop outraging over opposing answers. What works for you, won’t always work for everyone else, and vice-versa. It’s okay. Really, it is. Take a deep breath. It will be okay.</p>

<strong>The Nutcracker, Mumbai: 4 </strong>/ 5<br />Cuisine: Casual, Cafe (All vegetarian, they serve eggs)</blockquote>
<p>It’s hot and humid. You’re trekking down an alleyway, following the advice of a must-visit place where ‘everything on the menu is delicious’. And you’re dying for a salad after a week long gluttony that comes with travel.</p>
<p>As you perspire your way to the door, you’re greeted with a quaint, bustling, cozy little cafe that has extra stools hanging upside down on the walls. Interesting.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>The Nutcracker </em>itself, a table seems almost hard to find at lunchtime, and there’s little room to wait. Thankfully this phase of our journey only lasts about 10 minutes and we’re ushered to a table. As the waiter eventually comes up to us, I order the Asian salad and I put forth my eternal drink question: “Is your iced tea made in-house?” With the answer in the affirmative, we can proceed.</p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Homemade Iced tea, Potato Wedges &amp; Chargrilled Veg Salad</figcaption></figure>
<p>We feel like our order is too healthy, so a side of potato wedges are quickly added. These crispy bits of heaven remind me of <a href="https://youtu.be/F-VsLRVemzk?t=2m13s" target="_blank">Heston Blumenthal’s triple cooked chips</a>, such is their perfection. And yet I’m blown away most by a condiment—the fresh wholegrain mustard. Such is Nutcracker’s attention to detail that even this — this delicious, lick it off your fingers mustard — is stellar.</p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Asian Salad w/ grilled tofu</figcaption></figure>
<p>The refreshing Iced tea and the delicious Asian Salad makes my lunch absolutely worth it. The tofu grilled vegetable salad is equally good, but the tanginess and zing of the Asian salad makes it our favorite of the meal, at par with 5-star versions of this dish.</p>
<p>As we slowly cool down and settle, it’s time to leave. But not before the 3 people almost breathing down our necks have started where our experience began, ready to take over our table.</p>
<p>I hear the burgers are pretty good too.</p>

<p><em>Note: I was invited to a complimentary meal at fournil de Pierre, with no obligation for a review.</em></p>
<p>My absolute first thought on entering <em>fournil de PIERRE</em> last week, inhaling the aroma of a combination of freshly baked bread and freshly ground pepper (oh my) was that my <a href="http://blog.chirag.biz/post/45821755870/nanaji" target="_blank">grandfather</a>, an avid bread fan — his last trip to Dubai was spent eating LPQ bread for breakfast every day — would have absolutely loved the place!</p>
<p>Indeed, the place seems to have it just right. Its ambience, fragrance and decor transported us away from the Dubai hustle and bustle to a place where fresh bread, delicious soups and pastries can be had multiple times a day without any effect to your waistline. The influence was completed by French music playing away above us, and an extremely smiling wait staff. I think I’d have melted if they spoke to me with a French accent, but alas, that wasn’t to happen.</p>
<figure>

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/052e9-0a3uuuvvqks_77fkh.jpg" />
</figure>
<p>The menu is diverse, covering soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, pastries, you know the drill. I can confirm that the French Onion soup is the best I’ve ever had, served in a lovely crusty bread and I absolutely need to go back for a sandwich that had some combination of organic bread, green apples and goat cheese.</p>
<figure>

<img src="https://cdtestweb.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/5d7b3-0ggj1bfs-jujvia9n.jpg" />
</figure>
<p>I was also pleasantly surprised by a mocktail — peach puree, pineapple and…spinach. I only agreed to try it out of utter curiosity — a spinach and peach drink? — and I learnt that it was not just possible but that spinach, when added subtly can enhance a peach puree brilliantly. We concluded that the chef clearly knows his combinations. Worth a try.</p>
<p>A visit to a patisserie cannot be complete without dessert. The chef’s recommended strawberry cheesecake was extremely fresh, and different compared to the usual American cheesecake varieties I’m used to. And the little star was the White Forest, baked with a hint of pineapple.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a lovely getaway, and thankfully not inside a mall. I’m not sure how they’d handle being packed to the brim, but if it was anything like the other night, you can safely bet I’ll be in that crowd.</p>
<p>Check ‘em out, mes ami(e)s. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

<p>Who wasn’t excited to hear about the Cheesecake Factory’s opening in the Dubai Mall in August? I was — having loved their menu during my last visit to the US, not to mention all the Big Bang Theory love — but when I learnt of the long wait times, decided I should let some time pass before trying it out.</p>
<p>Not that it mattered. We ventured down to celebrate a birthday, and, lo and behold, the lines had not died down at all. “1.5 hours” said the polite hostess as she handed us a little buzzer that would let us know when our table was ready. Yup, that’s how organized their wait cycle is.</p>
<p>And how long their lines still are.</p>
<p>(Btw, that’s the waiting line to get on the waiting list for a table.)</p>
<p>We opened with the lettuce wraps, something I had tried and loved <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">during my US visit</a>, and was curious to see how that translated over.</p>
<p>‘Rather well’ is the answer. The produce was fresh, the sauces delicious as always and the appetizer gained a thumbs up around the table.</p>
<p>What is a bummer though: they’re not selling their dressings &amp; sauces like <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">they do in the US</a>. Bummer, bummer.</p>
<p>I have to talk about the ‘eggplant burger’ — it’s not exactly called that on the menu — but it is, by far, the best rendition of a grilled eggplant anything I’ve had at a meal. Wrapped in a burger bun, topped with fresh melted cheese &amp; grilled onions and cooked to absolute perfection.</p>
<p>The waiter might have been confused what the sandwich looked like (we were told it was a flatbread sandwich rather than a burger), but the chef most certainly was not. You may be a meat eater or an eggplant hater, but you’re going to have a hard time saying no to this. Ya hear me, Poston?</p>
<p>I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to classify the Factory into a specific cuisine, but at least they do them all well. With over 200 items on the menu, deciding what to eat was hard.</p>
<p>We figured quesedillas were as different as the food was going to get, and these deserve a mention for being served with the freshest guacamole (yes, just about everything we had that afternoon had some avocado in it, but no regrets), delicious salsa and rich sour cream. The quesedillas were kept simple, just the way I like them.</p>
<p>No celebration is complete without a slice of cheesecake — well, no visit to the Factory is complete without one either — and, <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">just like in the US</a>, their staff obliged with a little deco to make the slice look as festive as possible.</p>
<p>What’s interesting overall about my experience is the consistency. Even the look and feel of the decorated plate matched its US counterpart. Don’t believe me? <a href="http://blog.naihar.com/710976" target="_blank">Take a look for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>The food was delicious, fresh and something you’d definitely want to go back for. The place is buzzing with activity, and if you can get around the incredible wait times — to be fair, it can’t be that hard to kill time in the Dubai Mall right? — you’re in for a treat.</p>

<p>At first I was apprehensive, but it won me over. Green tea, mint &amp; lemon.</p>

<p>‘My choice’.</p>
<p>Well written &amp; voiced over. Can’t say I totally heart the video but I like the message.</p>

<p>Gorgeous track.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" target="_blank">Apple’s Macbook reveal</a> uses this as its background score, which might seem like an obvious choice considering they went gold. But what’s even better is the artist represents the song with three models in the video, against the three available with this Macbook’s release — silver, space gray and gold. Talk about attention to detail.</p>
