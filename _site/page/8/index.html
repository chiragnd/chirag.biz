<blockquote>“India today joined the distinguished club of countries that have malware-cleaning systems for the use of its citizens. As of now, we have 13 banks and internet service providers using this facility. With the expanding digital footprint in the country, I see a surge in start-ups in the area of cyber security by the end of the year,” said Union IT and Electronics Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at the event here.</blockquote>
<p>Another good element is the launch of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT-In) in the States, rather than just at the Centre.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2017/02/19/while-digitalisation-has.html">While digitalisation has proceeded, cash has not become unimportant</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://www.orfonline.org/expert-speaks/india-digital-payments-cash-here-to-stay/" target="_blank">Rupa Subramanya, writing for the Observer Research Foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Using data on the value of Point of Sale, Debit and Credit Card (PoS) transactions going back to April 2011, the earliest for which data is readily available, and the value of Immediate Payment Systems (IMPS) from September 2012, again the earliest for which data is available, I trace the dynamics of these two important components of digital payments.</blockquote>
<p>As always, Rupa brings in elaborate research and looks at longer-term trends.</p>
<p>On digitalization of the economy:</p>
<blockquote>It’s a no brainer that digitalisation of the economy has been underway well before demonetisation and is sure to continue post-demonetisation.</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/ek-drishti/retail-inflation-lowest-in-5-years-ac3969b0178a#.4lb1u9dek" target="_blank">I raised a similar point about the drop in inflation</a>. Analyses that only look at trends post-demonetization fail in many ways, particularly in understanding how demonetization was an impetus, not a sudden strategic change in the larger picture. To this point:</p>
<blockquote>The crux is that those who claim that digitalisation fell in January by looking at only two or three data points completely miss the fact that this is still more than we would have had if demonetisation hadn’t occurred! The narrative of a sharp rise and then drop in digitalisation is simply misleading and based on poor data analysis. Even a cursory analysis of long term trends shows we’re still above trend, due to demonetisation.</blockquote>
<p>On cash in the economy:</p>
<blockquote>…while digitalisation has proceeded, cash has not become unimportant. It’s necessary to stress that this trend for cash incorporates a couple of months of data following demonetisation. If demonetisation indeed leads to less cash in the economy, we should see this elasticity fall over time.</blockquote>
<p>India has been a predominantly cash economy, and that’s not just a colloquial statement. After all, 1000 and 500 Rupee notes comprised 86% of the denomination in circulation. Even the Government has been focused on the narrative of a ‘less-cash’ economy. While numbers haven’t been revealed yet by the RBI, it does seem that the final cash in circulation number will be far short of the Rs. 15.44 lakh crore that was in circulation on Nov 8.</p>
<p>Rupa also correctly concludes that the foot cannot be lifted off the peddle now, not for quite a while. Read on for a detailed analysis, salivating stuff for the data nerds out there.</p>

        <p><a href="http://in.mobile.reuters.com/article/idINKBN15S1BB" target="_blank">Shailesh Andrade, reporting for Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Consumer prices rose by an annual 3.17 percent last month — their slowest pace since January 2012, when the government launched the current index series.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 3.22 percent from a year earlier, compared with December’s 3.41 percent increase.</blockquote>
<p>The article attributes the higher than expected drop to demonetization. The data, though, seems to indicate that while demonetization may have supplemented the decline, it is not the root cause — there has been a near consistent decrease in inflation since 2014, and would imply other economic and governance reasons are also playing a part. The trendline therefore makes for positive reading.</p>
<p>Since July 2016, which is the peak 6% seen last calendar year and 3 months pre-demonetization, it has dropped consistently month-to-month to end at 3.17% in January.</p>

<p>Those are good numbers that will boost India’s now active ‘Act East’ mantra. That said, shouldn’t we be trying to at least go 3G with new lines? Considering the target completion date, North East citizens will <em>finally</em> get just 2G connectivity in 2019?</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2017-18/bs/bs.docx" target="_blank">From Arun Jaitley’s budget speech</a>:</p>
<blockquote>142. During the period 8 November to 30 December 2016, deposits between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs 5.03 lakh.</blockquote>
<p>This amounts to INR5.48 lakh crores. On average though, what percentage of people who have INR 5 lakhs+ in cash have it for say a wedding or house purchase due to the requirement of cash/black money? Also, this is based on deposits made, so perhaps more than one deposit could have been made by the same person in different accounts, which will be tallied down the road.</p>
<p>This would imply that a decent volume of this cash could be both probed, and result in further tax collections.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<blockquote>Deposits of more than Rs 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs 3.31 crores.</blockquote>
<p>That’s another INR 4.89 lakh crore, and again, questions would be raised about availability of cash per person in excess of 3 crores.</p>
<p>This would imply that a good percentage of about INR 10 lakh crores of deposits (out of a total INR 15.44 lakh crores estimated to be in circulation) will result in tax collections.</p>
<p>So far, about <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/18-lakh-taxpayers-to-get-it-notices-to-explain-large-deposits-4500918/" target="_blank">18 lakh notices have already been sent out</a> in cases where deposits do not seem to be inline with income tax returns.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://medium.com/u/5c6977d2a94f" target="_blank">M.G. Siegler</a>’s yearly ritual, here’s my home screen as of the first day of 2017. Most of these are fairly obvious, but I’ll add some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>WhatsApp/Social apps + photos + google maps are pretty much no brainers.</li>
<li>I don’t why Apple News is still here, I never open it.</li>
<li>At some point, I’ll dissolve Reminders and stick with just the one to-do app (2Do).</li>
<li>Yes, Outlook is current email client of choice on iOS.</li>
<li>Messages is blowing up thanks to all the places who have my mobile number and insisted on wishing me a Happy 2017 #iFeelSoPopular</li>
<li>MyFitnessPal is pretty much on its way out since the arrival of the Apple Watch. Granted, its purpose was altogether different, but my zeal to track everything I eat died about 45 days after I started.</li>

<p>See you in 2018.</p>

<p>I use headphones a lot. All my calls are done with headphones, unless I blunderously forget them at home in the morning. I also seem to have lost my tolerance to hold up a phone to my face for more than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I know Bluetooth headphones have tons of potential; I really enjoyed using the Parrok Zik phones with gesture support during my review a while ago, although I’m more an in-ear guy. But Bluetooth isn’t the easiest to use, pairing with multiple devices has been a pain, and there’s the lag problem. I can’t watch videos over my speaker bar using Bluetooth (I’ve noticed this with my car Bluetooth as well, but one doesn’t watch videos in the car to care enough really).</p>
<p>I’ve used the standard Apple headphones — I mean they do as advertised. I’m no audiophile so I can live without bass in general. It’s just, I have to untangle them multiple times a day. I usually shove my headphones into a pocket or a bag so it’s an ongoing battle.</p>
<p>What I’m rather obviously leading to is that the AirPods were an interesting announcement to me. There’s the obvious advantages: the W1 chip promises better connectivity &amp; pairing, true wireless — each ‘pod’ collects and plays sound independently while in sync with the other. I’m also mainly on Apple devices so pair once, use on all your iCloud devices definitely caught my eye. I don’t own an iPhone 7 mind you — I’ve made it through the I-want-to-upgrade-but-my-phone-works-just-fine phase successfully with some difficulty, but I think I can wait until the 7S comes out next year. #firstWorldProblems</p>

<p>Back to the review. I’ve had the AirPods for over a week now and they’re a delight to use. Well they’d better be considering the price tag. After some serious underpromising — 3 weeks expected shipping, followed by a Jan 3 delivery date, revised to Dec 20 — the AirPods arrived 8 a.m. Dec 19. Took all of 10 seconds to pair the iPhone and iPad. My MacBook (is old, and doesn’t support Bluetooth 4) didn’t pick it up, but a quick regular Bluetooth pairing process later, we were good to go. I also attempted to pair the AirPods with a Windows 7 PC — they did pair but Windows couldn’t find a driver for them, so I haven’t been able to use them as of the time of writing this review. I also have no idea if the behavior is different on Windows 10.</p>
<p>They do take a bit of getting used to, and I’m still getting the odd stare when I walk with them on (which is nearly all the time). They are incredibly light and you don’t realize how much having a wire tugging at earpieces adds weight to your ears … I have yet to drop them or send my phone catapulting to the floor because the wire got caught in something.</p>
<p>You suddenly don’t feel bound to your phone and it’s <em>very </em>easy to forget inside your ears if there’s no music playing.</p>
<h4>Battery</h4>
<p>Battery life has been very comfortable.</p>
<p>As a full test, I charged the pods + case on a Tuesday evening around 9 p.m. I forced myself to use the AirPods all day Wednesday between music and calls upto about 6 p.m., stopping just to charge the pods in the case when they ran out. If I wasn’t on calls, the pods ran for 5+ hours. At home, I watched about an hour of Netflix on the iPad with the pods and took another call.</p>
<p>On Thursday I didn’t force their use and listened to music as I would normally, with more interruptions compared to Wednesday. I returned the pods to their case when I wasn’t using them.</p>
<p>I took a conference call around 3 p.m. on Thursday with the pods themselves already at about 12%. When they touched 10% (a little beep sounds to inform you of this), I placed one pod back in the case to charge while using pod 1. In about 5 minutes, pod 2 had reached about 32%, so I swapped pods, continuing the call on pod 2 alone. Since I could go longer, I waited about 15 minutes before I swapped again, this time pod 1 was at a healthy 70-something. Once pod 2 touched 50%, I used both pods until the call was over. (I did have a lightening port available to me, but I didn’t want to re-charge it until absolutely necessary). So basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pods naturally lose battery faster when you’re on a call than just listening since the mic/noise cancellation are at play.</li>
<li>The pods charge much faster than they discharge (and this was while I was on a call). This allowed me to charge one when I was low on battery enough to swap this couple times and have 50%+ charged AirPods available to me without interrupting my call.</li>
<li>Even if you have about 5 hours per pod, if you’re short on case charge, you could technically get about ~10 hours with using just one at a time before anything needs to be charged. Since the case charges with the same lightening port though, I haven’t yet been in this situation yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recharged the case late Thursday evening. My overall experience is that the only difference in usage of the wired vs wireless is that the wireless ones are charging in their case when I’m not using them while the wired ones are shoved in a bag or across my nightstand.</p>
<h4>Video</h4>
<p>There also hasn’t been any lag at all. I’ve watched a decent share of netflix and YouTube since getting the AirPods. I’ve watched a video on my iPhone, then switched to the iPad and watched an episode and the only stop is changing the output on the iPad to pick up the pods. It is as seamless as advertised.</p>
<h4>Range</h4>
<p>Reports say you can go as far as 150m away from your phone. I haven’t measured this, but I can happily walk all over my room without losing connectivity, and I’ve walked around the office around corners and it takes a while to lose connectivity. It also picks up as soon as I’m back in range and keeps playing. Yes, removing a single pod instantly stops music or video; returning the pod resumes music but doesn’t do the same with say a Netflix video. I did this with my wired ones all the time to have a quick talk or to place an order and not having the music continuing in your other ear without having to fidget with the phone is nice.</p>
<h4>Problems?</h4>
<p>Apple is allowing you to buy pods individually it seems, but that doesn’t make me feel any better about my fear of losing one. With some conditioning, I generally return them to their case when not in use. I’m also hoping battery life won’t drop too drastically over time. But I’ve enjoyed a feeling of not being bound to my phone — both literally and figuratively. I can actually leave my iPhone behind and take my weekly stroll for example.</p>
<p>What do I miss? Easily skipping tracks. I’m not much of a Siri user, and using Siri to change tracks is far too slow. Siri’s voice capture has either improved over time, or is just better with the AirPods mic though. The AirPods obviously have a restrained surface area to support gestures, but I wouldn’t have minded a slide to skip or such. As opposed to just a tap to receive calls aka Bluetooth dongles of er, <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/07/07/30/review_apple_iphone_bluetooth_headset" target="_blank">2007</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of wires and how light the AirPods are almost feels like music is playing in your head. It’s oddly liberating. I’ve also dropped my phone less when the wire would get caught in something; or get yanked out of my ear. In fact, the AirPods did not drop out of my ears once, doing anything one would normally expect to do: sit, stand, get under the table to sort out wires, walks, light jogs, sideways tilts. As I mentioned, I almost forget they’re there if music is not playing. I suppose it feels more odd to the person you’re talking to; I’m not being rude, I have genuinely forgotten I’m still wearing them.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2016/11/16/postdemonetization.html">Post-demonetization</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I’m not an economist, or any kind of finance wizard. That said, here are the various angles I see from a more macro-economic point of view. There were two main areas in my opinion that were the target of this currency demonetization.</p>
<ol>
<li>Corruption: India largely thrives on a what is terms as a parallel economy; double account bookkeeping is one of those unwritten ways of managing things. Take the example of real estate, the way to sell or buy property is by division between check payment (i.e., accounted money) and cash (unaccounted and therefore, not taxed). To facilitate this transaction, prices stay inflated. Another example would be wholesale traders who buy (and account for) stock partly officially, partly unofficially. When stock is sold though, traders would want to cover all costs though, so the price will always stay up (cost + tax + profit + cost of unaccounted stock). Sometimes this stock even gets hoarded, causing artificial scarcities which further drives prices up. It is also hard to track this stock since this is kept off book. Tax not paid on these parallel transactions is just one of the problems. What the demonetization has done is invalidate the ‘cash’ aspect of these transactions. Cash collected thus far unaccounted is negated, with further transactions nearly impossible. It also strikes a fear at the heart of these transactions, with murmurs that businessmen and traders are figuring out how to keep their transactions entirely white here on. Even if 20% traders decide this out of those that don’t transact in white, that’s quite a shift.</li>
<li>Terrorism. India suffers tremendously through cross-border terrorism, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/UnSubtleDesi/status/783631629826691072" target="_blank">a total of 6,255 jawans have lost their lives</a> (that’s not counting general public). Terrorism is funded primarily through two means — black, unaccounted money or fake currency (termed the Fake Indian currency network, or FICN). By devaluing the currency, a lot of this cash in hand is now useless. By the time the entire outfit resets itself to use the new currency — whether printing, or just getting ahold of cash outside the system — gives India the driving seat, by months at least. Already a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3939368/Maoists-RED-Modi-s-currency-crunch-cripples-Naxal-guerrilla-activities-Rs-7-500-crore-buried-underground-worthless.html" target="_blank">near-term impact can be seen</a>, schools reopened in Kashmir a couple of days ago, and a 94%+ attendance in exams after unrest that has lasted a quarter. Additional, news has been coming in on a joint India-China task force to crackdown on fake currency.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a secondary string of ‘benefits’ due to demonetization.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bank liquidity: With the requirement to deposit cash back into bank accounts and the limits in place, there is a massive boost to bank liquidity in the past week. In the first two days alone, approximately INR 53,000 crore was deposited, against INR 700 crore withdrawn. Cash consistently outside the banking system — and I mean accounted/white and black — isn’t great for liquidity, and this turns into a tremendous boost to banks.</li>
<li>RBI: In hand with (3), there is also a wiping of debt from India’s central bank. An estimated 14 lac crore rupees was out as cash in 500s and 1000s pre-8 Nov. A conservative estimate says 20% of this cash may not return, and since RBI will print new currency against what is accounted, this would mean a reduction in total actual cash that is printed. Using the same estimate, that’s about 2.8 lac crore (in black money) that is wiped out of the economy, and the RBI would only have outstanding currency printed as 11.2 lac crore instead of 14. Again not being an economist I may not be able to fully elucidate every benefit of this but this is definitely a positive. Considering money is being thrown away, and burnt in the aftermath, I do believe this estimate is fairly realistic.</li>
<li>Prices: prices will come down. Already reports are coming out that wholesalers are dumping stock to compensate losses and fear of transaction issues. A large percentage of real estate transactions will stop seeing the black side of the transactions altogether; resulting in first a slump in prices as the market grapples with the aftermath, followed by a proper correction in prices to more realistic numbers that I believe will still be lower than pre-8Nov values.</li>
<li>Government dues collections: There is a massive rise in Government dues collections since 8 Nov. Since Govts are allowed to collect payments — taxes, fines and electricity — until Nov 24, a lot of people are attempting to clear out their payments and dues using old currency. This has resulting in an instant rise in Government collections. For example, Maharashtra State Governement and local bodies saw a <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-local-bodies-mop-up-rs400-crore-bmc-nets-rs49-45-crore-in-3-days/story-oecCIRmVEMXk0MvM4mMdjP.html" target="_blank">collection of INR 400 crore in outstanding dues within 3 days</a>. That’s a start. Railways and Air travel, which is also accepted old notes, have already said <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2016/nov/10/no-cash-refunds-for-cancelled-tickets-above-rs-10000-1537114.html" target="_blank">no cash refunds will be provided</a> for large transactions to prevent this being used as a currency switcher.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Move to cashless economy</h4>
<p>I want to address this aspect since it is being brought up a lot. It does seem, if you analyze the Government’s moves since 2014, that there is in fact a gradually increasing nudge towards a more cashless economy (not entirely, but significantly higher than it currently is). Between pushing the poor to open <a href="http://www.pmjdy.gov.in" target="_blank">zero-balance zero-fee accounts</a>, the RBI building a <a href="http://www.npci.org.in/home.aspx" target="_blank">Unified Payments Interface (UPI)</a> for peer-to-peer fund transfers between institutions and finally demonetization requiring money to be deposited back into banks, various areas are already seeing a rise in cashless transactions (cards, check, etc). That said, I do not believe demonetization single handedly solves this; India is still largely a cashless economy. Once lies reduce, cash starts to find its way bank in the hands of the people, cash transactions will resume, especially since various places do not yet have the ability to accept electronic currency and cash is convenient. There will still be a shift, a percentage of people starting to use more plastic and bank transfers to manage in the interim will continue down this path, and the younger generation is more savvy and open to this as well. Gateway providers like PayTM and others will also look to cash in on the demonetization, so that will nudge the economy further.</p>
<h4>What happens next</h4>
<p>There’s a lot of talk around ‘this is not enough’, ‘this does not really stop black money’ and ‘how will introducing a higher (2000) denomination solve the problem caused by a lower (1000) denomination’. I think it’s important to remember what this was set out to do: in my opinion, this was to kill black, unaccounted cash out in the economy (and therefore directly attacking existing corruption and terrorism that is elevated by this cash). More has to happen to control further generation, naturally. Remember that simultaneous raids were carried out at 100s of jewelers, various industries around Nov 10 to clarify transfer of cash into these industries in the hope of emptying thus far stashed currency. Other moves such as requiring PAN cards for jewelry transactions above certain amounts are further aimed at limiting new generation. I do believe the real estate sector will be hit next if not already. A crackdown has already been announced against those who have bank deposits not matching their tax returns. These actions will push more and more people to be careful about whether they wish to indulge this route further, and the small percentage that will continue — as they do in every economy — will be far, far smaller than what they were pre-8Nov. The advent of GST expected in FY 2017 will further add to their pain.</p>
<p>Regarding the currency, it was natural that 14 lac crore in currency would not be circulated entirely in 500s. Someone has highlighted how a different higher denomination also curbs a deposit switcharoo, which has some merit, but is not easy to do. That said, there are two places where the new 2000 denomination really helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>By keeping a larger difference between 500 and the next denomination means the general perception will be to use (and therefore stock on) 500s over 2000s. This means that lesser 2000s will be printed in general (this has been stated anyway), and the difference in wipe out of existing currency in circulation will come out of the 2000 account. This would make it harder to stash the same volumes of currency entirely in black; and the next available denomination is straight down to 500, significantly multiplying the amount of currency required.</li>
<li>Also remember that getting hold of a 2000 requires some level of routing through the banking system. While an exchange option is available, a citizen is allowed to exchange a maximum of INR4,500 one-time (through filling out a declaration form). Any further 2000s will enter the system through accounted money, via bank withdrawals. This does mean it will be harder to then dispose this currency into the ‘black’ economy, not impossible, but significantly harder. If the tax authorities do their jobs right, unexplained disappearance/inconsistent expenses of currency will be curbed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I know and fully understand the micro-economic inconvenience being caused while banks come to terms with handling the onslaught of citizens wanted to exchange, switch and withdraw currency to manage their day-to-day. This post in no way minimizes that burden, and a shoutout must go to bank staff who are working double, triple shifts to help people. Various citizens are also visiting banks to distribute water, tea and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/TajinderBagga/status/797704324407099393" target="_blank">even help people fill out forms</a> as they stand in line, while switching to majority cashless transactions so they don’t add to lines. It is a testament to the resolve of the country that this is happening across the nation today.</p>
<p>Onward and upward.</p>

<p>News of an announcement flickered in around 7.50 p.m. IST, an address to the nation was on the cards. What followed is fairly accurately described as India’s biggest take on black (think money acquired through non-documented means) money. Some quick facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The existing (as of Nov 8, 2016) INR500 and 1000 notes will no longer be legal tender. Essentially you cannot use that to make purchases anymore*. Lower denominations continue as is.</li>
<li>* Various establishments including Petrol pumps, government hospitals will continue to accept these notes until midnight on Nov 11.</li>
<li>Banks will be closed during the day Nov 9, 2016, as will ATMs. Various ATMs will stay closed on Nov 10, 2016.</li>
<li>As a citizen, what you can do: starting Nov 10, you can deposit existing 500/1000 rupee notes into banks, post offices via accounts and you will be credited, until Dec 30, 2016.</li>
<li>After Dec 30, special RBI centers will continue to accept these denominations for deposit into accounts until end of the fiscal year, March 31, 2017.</li>
<li>New notes of INR500 and INR2000 will trickle into the banks over the next few days and weeks.</li>

</ul>
<p>If we look at how this has come full circle since 2014, when the new Govt. took over, you can almost see the plan coming together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion via Jan Dhan Yojna (accounts for every citizen). Bringing the average Indian into mainstream banking, where India lacked severely.</li>
<li>Income declaration scheme (IDS) in 2016. The Indian Government gave an opportunity to every citizen to declare black money until Sept 30, 2016 with penalties (45% of declared amounts), but without prosecution. Various notices of large transactions were sent to business owners before the window closed to serve as a warning.</li>
<li>GST beginning next Fiscal year, with centralized tax accountability.</li>
<li>Finally, the demonetization of the notes. By conservative estimates, even if 20% of the money is a no-show, approximately 3 lac crore of unaccounted money will be wiped clean from the system. Additionally, GST gets a near-clean accounting slate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there will be an inconvenience around getting all the existing notes into banks; and while businesses and shopkeepers refuse to accept the old notes. If people however give i<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/HerrBains/status/796019043375251456" target="_blank">t a chance, and look beyond the ne</a>xt few weeks, a massive move towards accounted, and cashless economy is in the offing. But stories are already coming out of shopkeepers who are offering items on credit until the new notes trickle out.</p>
<p>Spare a thought for those who hoarded black money over years and years, stored in the highest denominations, in cash, that just became food wrappers. Being unable to deposit this money in banks today, unable to exchange it for gold or other goods stifles them in ways that are unexpected. Add to that the announcement being made post 8 p.m., barely 4 hours before closing and post close of markets. It is being said that <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rs-500-and-rs-1000-notes-banned-how-modi-kept-his-black-money-masterstroke-a-secret-for-6-months/articleshow/55327863.cms" target="_blank">it was a closely guarded announcement between the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and RBI Governor</a>. I wouldn’t be surprised if most/all in the Cabinet were unaware <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PIB_India/status/795991686069428224" target="_blank">until their meeting the hour before the announcement</a>, as evidenced by the lack of understanding within the media what the announcement was for, until it was actually made.</p>
<p>This was indeed a colossal move. Watch it unfold.</p>
<p>Update, 10 Nov:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unexpectedly, people are <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANINewsUP/status/796562774600073216" target="_blank">queuing up</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796572422128410625" target="_blank">outside banks</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796569839427063808" target="_blank">all morning</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796577178460753924" target="_blank">in panic</a>.</li>
<li>Announcements filtered in late evening that unaccounted deposits, as compared to the declared income of the previous FY would be <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796380846747885568" target="_blank">subject to a 200% penalty</a>. In essence, one would pay 30% tax + 200% penalty, essentially 90% of the cash deposited.</li>
<li>Entirely expectedly, people are <a href="http://bit.ly/2fEaVPX" target="_blank">leaving cash on the streets</a>, or <a href="http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/sacks-burnt-rs-500-rs-1000-notes-found-uttar-pradesh-52674" target="_blank">burning it</a>.</li>
<li>Banks will operate normal working hours Sat, Nov 12 and Sun, Nov 13 to ease the transition.</li>
<li>CEA Arvind Subramanian is right is calling it a ‘<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796590914315685888" target="_blank">transfer of unaccounted wealth</a>’. In other words, this is the first time in a long time where honest tax-paying citizens will finally be glad to have been that way.</li>
<li>I expect real estate markets nationwide to crash for a while. As the industry with a large amount of unaccounted money paid, a massive inflation remained in property value which would be wiped clean due to this move. That said, in a few months, expect a gradual correction would bring prices to a more realistic value.</li>
